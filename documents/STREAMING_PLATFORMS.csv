0,HBO,Game of Thrones,0944947,"Let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)Breaking Bad"
1,HBO,Westworld,0475784,"As many sci-fi fans will know, the show 'Westworld' is based on the 1973 feature film of the same name (written and directed by Michael Crichton), and the premise is basically the same as it was then: In a future where technological possibilities are seemingly endless, a highly sophisticated theme park offers rich clients the chance to visit the long gone era of the Old West (Crichton later explored a variation of that theme in a certain well known novel - which was then adapted by a certain Mr. Spielberg - albeit with slightly different creatures than cowboys populating a slightly more ""jurassic"" environment).The show does a great job pulling the viewer immediately into 
 Westworld. Within 10 minutes of the first episode, the basic rules of 
 the theme park are established: paying guests called ""newcomers"" get to 
 interact with androids called ""hosts"" (which to the naked eye are 
 indiscernible from the guests) in a world dressed up like the Old West 
 - and in this world, the guest truly is king. The rules are brutally 
 simple: the visitors get to do whatever they like with - or to - the 
 androids. They can have a friendly chat with them, flirt with them or 
 embark on a spontaneous (or scripted) adventure with them - but they 
 can also shoot them, rape them, torture them and kill them at will. 
 Imagine a real-life version of the game 'Grand Theft Auto' (in a 
 slightly different setting) and you'll get the idea.The androids, on the other hand, are constructed and programmed in a 
 way that is supposed to inhibit them from physically harming ""living"" 
 creatures. At the beginning of the show - thanks to an interesting 
 choice of storytelling - we get to experience Westworld from the 
 perspective of the androids, which reveals a cruel detail about their 
 nature: they apparently experience emotions. Artificial or not, they do 
 feel pain and fear - as well as affection and anger, and they have no 
 idea that they don't count as ""real"" people (at least not to those who 
 call themselves real people). And while that detail certainly makes the 
 ""game"" even more thrilling and more realistic for the visitors, it 
 means that the shocking abuse some of the androids have to suffer is 
 harrowingly real to them.The way the show is constructed - so far - it immediately confronts the 
 viewer with very uncomfortable questions. How do we as humans behave 
 towards creatures we consider non-human? How excessive do we become and how thin does our layer of morality turn out to be if we're allowed to 
 live out all our fantasies without having to fear any consequences for 
 our actions? And at what point should a creature have rights similar to 
 those we demand for ourselves? How do we define ""sentient""? How do we 
 define ""human""? And how well do we actually understand - and how well 
 are we able to control - the amazing technology our species seems to 
 have acquired so suddenly?As an avid film fan, I found 'Westworld' immediately intriguing; not 
 only because it dares to challenge the viewer with fascinating 
 philosophical questions and scientific concepts, but also because its 
 premise offers the chance to explore a wide range of film genres: sci- 
 fi, western, drama, horror - to name but a few. In the first few 
 episodes alone, there are hints of many of my favorite films and 
 stories such as (obviously) 'Frankenstein', 'Blade Runner', 'A.I.', 'Ex 
 Machina', 'Jurassic Park', 'The Truman Show' and 'Rise of the Planet of 
 the Apes' (and I suspect somewhere down the road there will be a strong 
 'Spartacus' vibe). As for the non plot related aspects of the show: 
 production design, music and effects are fantastic - as we've come to 
 expect from HBO's high concept productions - and, with very few 
 exceptions, the impressive ensemble of high caliber actors do a great 
 job at bringing their respective characters to life (artificial and 
 otherwise).A special mention needs to go to Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins: their 
 charismatic screen presence is once more just impossible to ignore and 
 they simply own every scene they're in. Generally speaking, there 
 really isn't much to complain about in 'Westworld' (so far), and I'm 
 pretty sure HBO have another winner. Given the amount of talent 
 involved, anything else actually would have been surprising. Produced 
 by J.J. Abrams, created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy Nolan based on a 
 concept by the late - great - Michael Crichton; directed by Neil 
 Marshall and Vincenzo Natali (among others), and with a cast most shows 
 would kill for, the stars really seem to have aligned for 'Westworld'.My overall verdict so far: 'Westworld' is intelligent science fiction 
 for adults (some scenes are very graphic) which offers more than just 
 eye candy and is full of mysteries for the patient viewer to uncover. 
 The show's main themes may not be new, but I found the way they are 
 presented never less than compelling. It succeeds in creating a 
 powerful metaphor for oppression, and by showing how quickly humans 
 tend to deem ""un-humane"" treatment of other beings acceptable - once 
 they've managed to convince themselves they're ""less"" human than they 
 are - the show drove a point home that resonated strongly with me. 8

2,HBO,Silicon Valley,2575988,"I have been a member of IMDb for many many years now and am a big movie and TV enthusiast. That said, until now, not once have I felt the need to type up a review. Silicon Valley if possibly the funniest show I have seen, ever. The writing is thoughtful, with perfect comedic timing. The only word to describe the characters is awesome. They all work so well together that the comedy flows effortlessly. I am surprised to see that this show is coming from HBO. I would expect a show like this from Netflix but not HBO. But I must commend them because they hit this one out the park. I look forward to what I hope will be a long lasting series with many more seasons to come. You can see from my profile that I have been a member here for many years and have not ever written a single review, so you can be assured that what I say is true. If you haven't seen Silicon Valley you are missing out. Go check it out!"
3,HBO,Barry,5348176,"I agree with everything good said about this black comedy and can only emphatically add that the Chechen gang is exquisitely crafted and hilarious. Perhaps the most extraordinary character, the bald Noho (""Can I get you a submarine sandwich?""), is unforgettable. Just a brilliant performance. The ridiculous twins, one who is obsessed with killing Barry and then his tortuous brother who insists on building a set of stocks, are wonderfully absurd."
4,HBO,The Sopranos,0141842,"The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history.Its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing or first rate performances.Across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group, of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and The Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy. Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man. Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony.The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever.The true genius of this tale however, is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series. Twenty minute long dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love, honour and respect for family. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America's most original and compelling drama. Forget Family Redifined. This is Television Redifined."
5,HBO,True Detective,2356777,"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
6,HBO,The Wire,0306414,"Along with TV-shows like 'Oz', 'Deadwood', 'The Sopranos' and 'Six Feet Under', David Simon's 'The Wire' was part of a revolution - qualitywise - in television. Although it is very entertaining, this isn't just entertainment; this is art, pure and simple - and the concept of this show was groundbreaking. On the surface, one might think this is a show about crime, but really, 'The Wire' is about the life and soul of a whole city. Every aspect of the city of Baltimore gets its share of screen time, and the way this is done - the writing, the direction, the amazing performances by the terrific cast; the music, the camera work, the realism... I could go on and on - is just outstanding. On par with 'Generation Kill' (no wonder, since the same creative team was behind both), this is as good as television gets.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
7,HBO,True Blood,0844441,"Dracula living in a trailer park instead of a castle. NOSFERATU out on the bayou. THE LOST BOYS hangin' out down by the Chattahoochie with a keg, instead of in an underground lair with a beachfront view. A great dinner of catfish, blackeyed peas and rice and cornbread, served up with a tall, warm, bubbly bottle of...BLOOD.However you want to describe it, TRUE BLOOD is not only unlike any vampire story that's been done before, it's not like any series that's on right now. It's DARK SHADOWS-meets deep-fried Southern Gothic, and only Alan Ball, the creator of SIX FEET UNDER, would dare stick his neck out to bring it to you.Based on the novels of Charlaine Harris, which I've never read, (but certainly will after this!), BLOOD takes place in the not-too-distant future. It's been two years since the world got a shock it never expected: vampires came ""out of the coffin"" as a race. We suspected they always lived - and fed - amongst us, but now it's official, and just as before with race relations and as it is now with GLBT people, the reaction across the board is the same - fear of change and fear of the unknown influences most people's feelings about it. And it doesn't seem to matter much that vamps now opt for finding nourishment from a bottled beverage made of synthetic plasma called - wait for it - ""TRU BLOOD"", rather than from the warm, breathing, two-legged receptacles called Everybody Else.Sookie Stackhouse, however, has her own unique take on the whole deal. Sookie (X-MEN'S Anna Paquin) lives and works as a waitress in Bon Temps, LA, at a roadhouse restaurant called Merlotte's, the center of most of the series' action. She serves up pitchers of beer and sweet tea, and will give you a piece of her mind, once she has a piece of yours...though you'll wonder how she knew what you were thinking. Sookie is a telepath, and unfortunately for her, she can't turn off the constant flow of other peoples' streams of consciousness...most of which offers way too much information.The only minds she can't read are vampire minds, something she discovers when she encounters Bon Temps' first vamp, the courtly and smoldering Bill Compton (Brit actor Stephen Moyer in a bravura performance). They are taken with each other on first sight - Sookie, who is not afraid of the unusual since she herself fits that category all too well, and Bill because he cannot figure her out - is she mortal, or something more?Looking on this blossoming romance in various stages of curiosity, disgust or outright disapproval are Sookie's brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten), a walking hormone on two legs whose IQ matches his boot size; headstrong, opinionated Tara (Rutina Wesley), Sookie's childhood BFF; Sam Merlotte himself (Sam Trammell), Sookie's boss, who's got it bad for her and wears his heart on his sleeve on and off the clock; Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis), the boldly out, proud and randy cook who serves as Greek chorus, instigator and confidante to Merlotte's employees, but most especially to Sookie, and her 'Gran', Adele Stackhouse (the marvelous Lois Smith), who couldn't be happier that Sookie is romantically involved with somebody...even if he is undead. Not a single opportunity is wasted here to explore every nuance of mixing the ordinary with the extraordinary, in a way that even a series as outstanding as BUFFY could only get close to. Passion burns, secrets abound, betrayal, murder and things even worse lurk around every corner. It's what you've hoped for but never gotten from every soap opera that couldn't show you what was REALLY going on...until now.Best of all, TRUE BLOOD is like the best songs that come from Mississippi Delta blues. It has an irresistible melody and a driving beat that pulses with sex, muscular sensuality and undeniable heat, with an undertone of menace lurking just beneath, ready to explode without warning...and sometimes even without provocation.As with 6FU, Ball and his crew are firing on all cylinders here in the first two episodes I've seen. I sure hope they can keep it going...With the early renewal for a second season, HBO sure seems to agree, and so do the fans. Especially this one."
8,HBO,Sex and the City,0159206,"In its 6 year, 94 episode run, we've seen the four girls grow and develop through their relationship, neuroses, and daily life in New York. The main narrator and the girl who 'knows it all' is Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) who writes a sex column for the newspaper and has a bizarre taste in fashion. Her on-off boyfriend is the mysterious Mr Big (Chris Noth), who has dreadful chat-up lines and a big ego, but there have been others - notably the sweet Aidan (John Corbett, fresh from 'Northern Exposure') and the mysterious Russian artist in the final series (played by Mikhail Baryshnikov).Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) is pure Park Avenue, looking for the man of her dreams. He isn't Trey MacDougall (Kyle MacLachlan), although they have a good try making things work; he turns out to be baldy divorce lawyer Harry instead. While we see Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) move from power-suited lawyer to earth mother, with the cute Steve Brady (David Eigenberg); Samantha (Kim Cattrall) - man-eater and contortionist extraordinaire - finds love after a last season bout of personal trauma.The strengths of 'Sex in the City' are mainly in the tone of Carrie's narration, some of the situations we see (the sex therapy session; the dance on the roof; all those opening nights at chic clubs), and the supporting characters, especially Willie Garson as Stanford Blatch. SATC was watchable throughout all its series, and remains so in repeated showings. I'll just miss seeing Carrie's wonderful frocks, how far Samantha will go this week, what Miranda will get worked up about, and whether Charlotte still believes in true love."
9,HBO,Ballers,2891574,"This is a show that deserves at least a 7.5 - 8.0. There's no show out there like it really right now. The actors are good, im not just talking about Dwayne Johnson but everyone else. They just go good with this show & what its about.I like shows like The League & I do like football so this does interest me but I do truthfully think even if you're not totally into football you would still like this for what it has to offer. It does obviously take a certain taste but its pretty common comedy so a lot would like it. Its not amazing or a Must Watch!!! but its worth it in my opinion. They cancelled a show that I did like the pilot of which was The Rebels which is also about football & its funny. It's good to see another one come along & hopefully it can remain around."
10,HBO,Boardwalk Empire,0979432,"This show is loaded with excellent acting and writing!!!!! It's worth watching every minute and shot. Steve Buscemi definitely deserves an Emmy for his portrayal of ""Nucky."" I haven't enjoyed a show from HBO this much since ""Deadwood."" The characters are well layered and the dialogue is fantastic. The supporting cast is immensely talented and the scenery is simply gorgeous. Michael Pitt is a pleasure to watch in his, complex role of the war hero gone bad. I hope this show lasts a lot longer than ""Deadwood"" did and makes household names out of its cast. I'll keep my HBO subscription forever if more shows like these are on the horizon."
11,HBO,Deadwood,0348914,"If you want to experience the – real – old west first hand, look no further; you'll find it in 'Deadwood'. There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws – but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this ""cesspool of vice"" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by ""the code of honour"", but real people whose moral standards are – in most cases – murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest – and the most cunning – survive. As far as the historical characters depicted in the show are concerned, the writers naturally had to take some liberties (after all, nobody knows exactly who said or did what at the time), but the depiction of the era and the historical background are very accurate. Yet this is not a history lesson; it's an immensely entertaining western-show blessed with some of the best writers and actors working in television and film today – and especially the cast of 'Deadwood' really can't get enough praise: there is not a single performance here that isn't excellent. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ian McShane. His Al Swearengen is one of the most morally complex and fun-to-watch characters I've ever seen (and he misses absolutely no opportunity to show you just what the first five letters in ""SWEAR-engen"" stand for). The power-struggles in Deadwood he is involved in – and since he wants to maintain his position at the top of the food-chain he's involved in all of them – are equalled in complexity and entertainment value only by those in top-notch shows like 'Game of Thrones', 'House of Cards' or 'Breaking Bad'. And the lengths Al is willing to go to achieve his goals secure him a place in the top ten of ""all-time great bad-asses"".So my verdict: While certainly not for the easily offended or those who prefer a ""sanitized version"" of the old west, 'Deadwood' offers a fascinating look at a time we mostly know from myths and legends and gives us a chance to revisit those and see them from a different angle. Great, intelligent and informative entertainment. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
12,HBO,The Leftovers,2699128,"Never before have I written a review on IMDb. Not a single one. Have been using this site since I was a young teenager (I am 25 now) and although I have been moved by and enthralled with television series and films in the past, never before has one compelled me this much to feel the need to formally post a review. That being said, The Leftovers made me write a review because it is one of the most criminally underrated, under watched and overlooked shows on television today (in America, at least). It is an absolute shame because this show is a true artistic and philosophical marvel. It forces you to truly think and truly feel while you are experiencing it, and that is something too few television shows and films do today. Nowadays, too many want a movie over a film; a show over a series. This masterpiece of a season, season 2, will be looked back upon one day as one of the greatest television seasons of any show all time. It is that rare new gem hidden amongst the knockoffs and hand me downs. Light years ahead of any competition.Without giving any spoilers, I will tell you that this show is like absolutely none you've ever experienced before, even with any possible similarities it has to other shows one could possibly compare it to (maybe Twilight Zone, Lost, Twin Peaks or Black Mirrors). The Leftovers has completely its own style and tone through amazing production value and direction. Not to mention, the writing and acting are both phenomenal and mind blowing. The depth and range of the characters and the actors playing them are beyond remarkable. The way it is shot, edited and the way they incorporate both the show's AMAZING score (beautifully haunting beyond measure) and outside songs into it make it into one totally cohesive and extremely powerful piece of art. This show is special beyond any comparison and moves you upon its own merit.The Leftovers deals with mystery, philosophy, spirituality, loss, pain, love, hate, truth and fiction and what it means to truly understand and deal with all of these things. Not to mention the supernatural and unexplainable elements of life, nature and humanity themselves. And it is a true marvel to watch.Please watch this show and you will not be disappointed! ( Well, unless you have awful taste and don't know what art is or you just don't like things that make you think and feel and question ;P ) Great things ahead for this series! Love love love what Lindelof Perrotta Leder and co are doing. Truly special to see every Sunday! 10/10"
13,HBO,Curb Your Enthusiasm,0264235,"I think too many people are looking to this show as a Seinfeld spin-off.  The truth is, it's not, and you have to take the show for what it truly is.  Larry David, in his great comedic brilliance, is not trying to glorify himself with this show, you can tell that just from watching one episode.  Instead, he is really utilizing a caricature of a rich, whipped, neurotic yuppie to skewer the image of life at the top.  His character (even though he is essentially playing himself), bumbles, complains, talks himself into painful situations, and is ultimately served devilishly funny comeuppance from episode to episode.  This self-deprecating humor wouldn't work for anybody else, but for a guy like Larry David, this material works perfectly, because he seems so easy to laugh at (and I have a feeling this is hardly accidental, which is why his comedy is truly brilliant.)  I really have to marvel at the idea of anyone NOT being able to laugh at this show. It's the greatest comedic take on life and the human condition that has ever been captured on film.  All other television comedies of this era pale in comparison.  ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is possibly the salvation of true comedy TV, in an age when good television comedies are few and far between."
14,HBO,Rome,0384766,"I Claudius was maybe the best miniseries ever. Now, there's Rome, and it's even better. I agree with another reviewer, that quibbles about historical inaccuracies, such as accents or how old so-and-so should be, are silly pedantry. I've been a Roman history buff ever since my own high school triumvirate of Caesar, Cicero and Virgil, and I say that this historical fiction is both exciting AND quite accurate with the important stuff.So far, every player has been terrific, in particular Ciarán Hinds as Caesar and Max Pirkis as Octavian. Julius Caesar was perhaps the most complex ""great"" figure in history. Was he a great populist, trying to champion the people against the Optimates, or was he an ambitious demagogue, who was using the Roman mobs to attain the imperium? Hinds depicts this complexity perfectly, while projecting a steely will that is shared by Caesar's emerging protégé, Octavian. Thanks to Max Pirkis's brilliant portrayal, we can already see the no-nonsense pragmatism, ruthlessness and brilliance that will propel this boy into becoming the greatest despot in history. And what about that dissolute Mark Anthony? We can already see Actium in his face. And with Atia, I think Livia (as depicted in I Claudius) and Messalina have met their match.And midst the struggle for mastery of Rome, we see the struggle of more common folk just to make a living. Rome makes the parallel stories of the Optimates and Centurian, now Prefect, Vorenus and Legionnaire Pullo a perfect vehicle for comparing the travails of different classes  their love lives, social lives, how they treated the servants, how they practiced their faiths, how they fought. Seen from these different perspectives (which we did not get with I Claudius), we get a three-dimensional view and, for me, the closest to feeling like one is actually there of any historical fiction ever produced.And look at the production values. Is it any wonder, when we see who's behind the camera  Michael Apted and John Milius  that we have an immaculately crafted work?By their commitment to quality of production and integrity of story, HBO and BBC are demonstrating what television can be. This is a wonderful, wonderful series. Anyone with a love of history, drama and spectacle should be devouring it with delight."
15,HBO,Entourage,0387199,"One of the best new shows in the last few years. Entourage brings the lifestyle of the young and famous in a likable sharply written easy to take in way. The key to this show is the writing, always witty and hard hitting. The writer's don't tame it down, it makes it easy to believe these are real people and gets you connected to the cast quickly. The realism of the series and the great guest stars they get is also a wonderful treat (sara foster, Scarlett Johanson, Jaime Presley, Ali larter to name a few). Ari Gold the super-agent is rapidly becoming one the most recognizable characters on HBO series with his hilarious lines and over the top antics. WATCH THIS SHOW!"
16,HBO,Girls,1723816,"I have seen many complaints about Girls only being relatable to a small sliver of the audience. I have also read someone defending it saying that we can't relate to the characters on Dowtown Abbey but still love it. I like Downtown Abbey. I think of Mary Crawley as a bit spoiled, high-minded, even snooty but still good natured and I like her with her faults and I am far from a British aristocrat. The maids, footmen, valets, and cook - I can't relate to their situation either... Secret is we do relate to them through their experiences, like Daisy learning to stand up for herself in a respectful way. Enough about Downtown Abbey...I think you CAN write a show about spoiled privileged self-absorbed white girls in their early 20's. Actually, that show could be really funny because on some level who doesn't like laughing at privileged sheltered girls stumbling through a big city? At the same time we are laughing, we are also being comforted by the fact that life isn't easy for anyone, learning from their mistakes, and watching them grow. I'm also not troubled by the fact that all the friends are white - I found this to be somewhat realistic. Even a boyfriend who is too nice can be upsetting - you want a partner, an equal, with opinions and not a puppy dog that follows you around. This sounds like I am going to start praising the show? All the main complaints about it don't bother me. However, my point of criticism was it forgot to be entertaining and the situations are poorly written. It isn't funny and I am bored to tears while watching it. The characters are also often just plain annoying.I saw an episode one night not knowing what it was. It was so boring, drab, and lifeless, I kept thinking what is this? Is it a show? Who could produce something so vanilla, limp, and dull? Thanks to the info button, I learned it was 'Girls.' So I googled it and found rave reviews and decided to watch some episodes - maybe I couldn't appreciate the show without seeing the story that came before. I watched the first 3 episodes, that makes 4 total and 4 too many. The show just fails on multiple levels, mostly at the satire it tries to be. I admit there are brief moments when the show rises above and realizes its potential, again, very briefly. Sometimes the lack of comedic timing kills a scene. The dialogue and interactions are also very simplistic and there is never any subtext. Things that bugged me in the first 2 episodes: The lighthearted abortion party was a little disturbing and I am completely pro-choice. So the British girl isn't the type to be emotional but she doesn't show up to her abortion and just confessed to you that she does want children (the conversation about her wanting children was one of the most badly written scenes I have ever watched.). What is your response? You are worried about your friend who is facing a huge life decision and is unsure about her choices? Worried she may be somewhere needing your support? Nope, you are annoyed she stood you up. What? The situation could be funny but NEVER in the way it is presented. The show then wimped out and balked on the unwanted pregnancy. (Also, she would have had a pregnancy test and medical exam to schedule an abortion so was she miscarrying?)Hannah makes a joke about date rape in her interview. OK, nose-diving in an interview should be funny and make you uncomfortable. Her date rape joke makes you cringe but not cringe at how out of touch Hannah is but cringe with who wrote this terrible show? Hannah's lover during sex wants her to pretend to be an 11 year old girl that he took from the street and is going to send home to her parents covered in semen (they use the other word) while shoving his hand in her face. He's a jerk but still this one, I... don't... get. Alright, it's all to character development and we aren't supposed to think they are the greatest people in the world - they are real with flaws. They certainly are not completely awful but whether we are supposed to be laughing at or horrified by them, we should be invested in their story. The characters inspire nothing. They aren't interesting, they aren't funny. I didn't like them or hate them and I didn't care. You don't have to like a character to root for them. I also had a nagging sense that the show was telling superficial people, it is OK to be this self absorbed.You shouldn't have to be living in a narrow section of society to like a show and relate to the characters - most shows I watch are far from depicting me but I like them, I relate, I laugh, I cry. So when a large chunk of people think a show is not relatable, it's the show's fault and not the viewers. The shows biggest failure is it's boring. I didn't absolutely hate it despite it making me cringe at times. It's just a blank void as vacuous as its characters."
17,HBO,OZ,0118421,"...if what you want is the usual depiction that passes for prison life in a dramatic format. No SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION here, folks, no benevolent GREEN MILE guards or saintly supernatural inmates. OZ tells it like it is, and baby, it ain't pretty.Using at times a sense of hyper-realism, (in the narrations of the excellent Harold Perrineau, who serves as the show's conscience and Greek chorus), OZ shows us both the profane and profound aspects of prison life that we good, law-abiding citizens don't like to think about. We have the ""authorities"" to take care of that, don't we?Exceptional art, no matter what the medium, has the ability to move us, make us think, make us feel both things we embrace and things we reject. The power this show has to polarize viewers into two different camps--love it or hate it--is proof enough that Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, the forces behind HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS, have fashioned something we haven't seen the likes of in a very long time.I would strongly suggest that anyone who has not yet seen it give it a try, if you have HBO. Then I dare you to tear yourself away from it. It's rare television that makes you sit up, take notice, and actually care about even the minor characters in an ensemble such as this, no matter how heinous their crimes, or how street-and-battle-hardened their exteriors.Augustus Hill, Simon Adebisi, Tobias Beecher, Vern Schillinger, Chris Keller, Jefferson Keane, Ryan O'Reilly, Kareem Said, Nino Schibetta, Bob Rebadow, Tim McManus, Warden Leo Glynn, Sister Peter-Marie, Father Ray, Officer Diane Wittlesey and all the others will imprint themselves on your memory and stay there, until you can't wait to find out what happens next.A blend of black humor and outright horror, cutting commentary and the basest brutality, it is one of the very few shows being done now that can reveal the most majestic qualities of the human spirit. The ongoing struggle to resist surrendering to impulses and urges that cause the evil that men do, in the one place you would least expect to find any light--in a sea of human misery and darkness."
18,HBO,Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,3530232,"No great offense meant to U.S TV, but most of its shows with hosts trying to make some fun of the recent affairs, politicians and all that jazz are usually crappy and saved by the ""bring a funny and/or weird celebrity"" bell. Of course, ""The Colbert Report"" and a few bits of the ""Daily Show"" are exceptions, but overall one must admit that even these don't really dwell too long in deep waters (meaning grave issues of major concern) like ""Last Week Tonight"" does. A couple of examples of serious satire from the first episodes are the death penalty, the hypocritical stance of politicians towards people like the Sultan of Brunei or even the fun'n'serious interview of the ex-chief of the NSA. The fact alone that such significant and highly debatable subjects are discussed is a huge win for the show. The end result airing on HBO, comes as no surprise to me. Their only commitment I have seen so far show-wise, is quality and creativity, two traits this show seems to possess.I am taken in by the first three episodes and honestly believe that this show has the potential to stimulate the brain and instigate belly-aching laughs at the same time. Hopefully, the creators will not take steps back, when possible pressure to ""lighten"" their material may arise - if and when a lot of people start watching the show. {Quick note to those who may feel offended by the approach John Oliver has on the ignorance of some people from the States, when it comes to the rest of the world: If you know your way around a world map and have an idea of what is happening elsewhere in this vast place called Earth, lay back and enjoy the sarcasm. If you can't do that, take the bitter pill.}"
19,HBO,Six Feet Under,0248654,"Six Feet Under is meticulous, beautiful, daunting, and powerful. One way or another, it will connect with you, perhaps in places you didn't expect and aren't willing to expose. At times wrenching, at other times cathartic, but always staring back at you knowingly, this show stands head and shoulders above the advertising-driven fare that clogs network TV with mediocrity, token minorities, and jarring commercial breaks. It changed the way I view television, and I recommend it to anyone who's tired of the same old crap.After watching the series finale (which I won't spoil, don't worry), I sat in bed, unable to sleep. After poring over everything I'd seen over the past season, it struck me that SFU is the most raw and personal television show I've ever seen. Even more, there are no stand-alone episodes for easy syndication. Every single installment is part of a huge puzzle, or a few more miles on the Fisher family's road. I've always found Peter Krause to be a disappointingly flat performer, which is unfortunate because his character anchors the show, but the other actors are often transcendent. Regardless, every one of them radiates with a sometimes painfully familiar pathos. The cinematography is also staggering sometimes, taken from film rather than typical 3-camera TV work. If that's not enough, the music they choose to score the episodes is almost symbiotic; it seems ingrained into the film itself, even when you know it was just licensed.This is not really a family-friendly show, though, encompassing profanity, nudity, violence, drug use, ""alternative lifestyles"" ... So in other words, it's just like real life. And despite the interpersonal conflicts that fuel the narrative to the point of melodrama, the show isn't afraid to pause every once in a while and let the show communicate without dialogue.I feel very gratified to have watched SFU, and I've never felt that way about any other show in the almost-27 years I've been alive. Hopefully it will start a trend, if only on premium cable."
20,HBO,Veep,1759761,"Like the rest of Ianucci's work, this is a fantastic political satire. The reflexive self-serving sycophancy, the arbitrary nature of power, the automatic deferral to the hidden powers behind the throne, the elevation of random dross above real issues (brilliantly lampooned in the pilot when the use of cornstarch forks in the White House becomes a stumbling block to setting up a clean jobs task force) are skillfully portrayed, showing how the dysfunction of the modern arena (especially the media's eye, usually passive but, as in the second episode, sometimes accompanied by a mouthful of vicious teeth) prevents the exercise of power for actual governmental function. None of the characters are perfectly likable, though all are well-played, but somehow the ensemble is endearing. Watch this if you want to see a sharp commentary on the drunken carousel that is politics."
21,HBO,The Larry Sanders Show,0103466,"The Larry Sanders show was the best, nastiest, and funniest comedy program on either side of the Atlantic during the 1990s.  Filmed without a laughter track, it features Garry Shandling as TV talk show host Larry Sanders (motto: ""No flipping!""), who we follow on and off camera.On camera, the Larry Sanders Show is slick, professional, and vacant, as celebrities appear pretending to be best of friends with Larry and delighted to be on the show when all they're really doing is plugging their latest product and when everyone in the paranoid entertainment industry actively hates everybody else.  Exactly like real talk shows, in fact.  As a parody, Larry Sanders is extremely subtle, aided by the fact that many A-list celebs from real life appear, showing a surprising willingness to send themselves up (David Duchovny, for example, features in one episode where the main storyline centres on his crush on Larry!).  It's bad, but not obviously: you can really imagine it on air (in sharp contrast to Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge, who in real life would never make it even to hospital radio).But the funniest material comes backstage.  The leading characters (Larry, his loser sidekick Hank, and his alternately tough-talking and sycophantic producer Artie) are all so horrible, the main joke is basically that everyone continually behaves in a manner both in character, and yet also worse than you could possibly expect.  The sheer unpleasantness of these individuals is jaw-dropping... you continually wonder ""did he really just say that?""  Hank, for example, after his agent has been hospitalised and he hasn't been allowed to visit, comments: ""It's so unfair! I mean so much to him!"" then immediately starts phoning potential successors.  The character of Hank is perhaps the best of all, his role on the show is to appear talentless and genial alongside Larry, a role he fulfills with partial success because he is naturally talentless but not in the least genial!  But all the cast (including many regulars) are wonderfully portrayed, Shandling is great but at the end of each brief episode you almost wish you had seen more of the others... in fact this is probably just another sign of the show's strength, instead of wheeling out our favourites each week for a familiar laugh, this show is always looking for fresh ways to make us uncomfortable.In some ways this is a very un-American program (there's not an ounce of sentiment, or a hint of redemption for its characters).  In the UK, Peter Kay's ""Phoenix Nights"" is perhaps the closest thing to a successor. But the Larry Sanders show remains a major loss from the late-night schedules."
22,HBO,Divorce,4304864,"I love SJP. I saw her in a Facebook Live interview talking about this show and her interest in long-term relationships, divorce, adultery, etc. and why couples stay together or fall apart. And how some thrive afterwards and some completely self-destruct. SJP, in real life, is so lovely, intelligent and fascinating, so I am willing to give this show a chance. I subscribed to HBO because of this show. The show is funnier than I expected. Love the musical selections, Poco's Crazy Love of Mine was unexpected and beautifully timed. It is not a predictable story yet - I do not know what direction these characters are headed in. As someone that has gone through a divorce myself and continued to live with my ex-husband for three years after the divorce, I can relate to Frances in some ways. The hardest, hardest part is your relationship with your children especially if you feel guilty about the divorce and wanting to save your own life."
23,HBO,High Maintenance (2016),6078096,This tv show is so good. I love the laid back and random way each episode evolves. you can't predict anything it is totally fresh and refreshing to watch. well written and acted. and just re upped for a 3rd season boom!
24,HBO,The Newsroom,1870479,"I have never felt as driven to make sure other people understood just how perfect a show was. Not for Game of Thrones, Firefly, Sopranos or any of the other shows I obsess about. But this show changed that! This show boils down everything that is wrong with America and puts out a simple answer to solving that. DO THE BLOODY NEWS LIKE IT'S NEWS NOT A HIGH SCHOOL PROM ELECTION! Jeff Daniels is perfect in his role as the tired beaten down journalist that just doesn't give a damn about anything anymore, but used too. And we can see the spark that ignites him to become great again. Why aren't real reporters like this? Why oh why? If this show get's cancelled I will camp out in front of HBO HQ and not leave till the last Game of Thrones series comes out (because I have to get on with my life at some point). This was my first review ever on IMDb, all because of this amazing show! You better watch it as well!"
25,HBO,Eastbound & Down,0866442,"This show is above and beyond what it deserves to be. What ought to be a dumb fun Danny McBride, Will Ferrell produced sports comedy vehicle is in fact a work of television genius. I am in love with this show. Every slow motion musical moment, every scene filled with such beautiful comedy and affecting drama. It is cast impeccably, each scene judged to perfection, and the score drifts you along, deep under it's trance. Each episode continues on from the last as if it were a 3 hour movie, and this, I feel, is how it is best viewed. I can not rate it highly enough. I only wish I could live forever, perhaps rather sadly in the warm glow of this series. It is an instant favourite.If you want your life to be better, watch this show. I only hope there are people out there who can enjoy it on the level that I did.Just glorious."
26,HBO,The Young Pope,3655448,"I guess I should start with what I don't like about this show - the dialogue is somewhat unnatural. There's no umming or erring at all, conversations are as rapid and resolute as in an American crime procedural, which is slightly weird most of the time but especially disturbing when coming from actors who aren't speaking in their first language, who happen to make up the vast majority of actors on this show. That's it as far as flaws though, and I won't even deduct any points for this one flaw because there's a positive aspect to it, to the point that I can't even be 100% sure it wasn't intended - it adds to the feeling of surrealism that permeates every scene in this unique and wonderful creation. And when I say wonderful I mean it literally - this show is full of wonders at every corner. It keeps you constantly surprised, on edge, unsure of what on earth could possibly come next. The plot, the writing, the cinematography, the acting, the music, oh the music! The choice of music, the placement of it. Every single one of these things is done with so much balls, finesse and confidence and to the highest degree of quality. And most importantly it's a fuckload of fun, never for a second taking itself seriously, the aforementioned surrealism constantly popping up where you least expect it. It's as much a colourful satire of TV shows, film and life itself as it is one of the Church.It's really rather hard to believe that Sky and HBO financed this gigantic odd piece of brilliantly experimental filmmaking. I'd never quite accepted what a few critics have begun to say recently, but with this show I think the penny's finally dropped for me on the notion that TV and streaming services are taking over the mantle of art in filmmaking. Which is really fortunate, since true artists like Sorrentino are finding it harder and harder these days to get movies made, and not only are many of them being given big budgets and free reign these days on TV (see also: Mr. Robot, The Knick) but this medium lets them tell much longer stories, and without being afraid that the audience will fall asleep or run off to the toilet with their bladders bursting. Praise our most holy father."
27,HBO,Vice Principals,3766376,"Here's the thing, Danny McBride's comedy is very much down to individual taste. In much the same way as Ricky Gervais's material it is meant to shock, make you cringe, make you laugh out loud and usually, in the end, make you realise that there can be moments of redemption for even the most self centred, unlikeable characters.The interplay in this between McBride and Goggins is brilliant. Goggins's insults drip with a hilarious straightforward honesty towards McBride's Gamby whilst McBride is happy to play second fiddle in the interchanges. The begrudged respect that develops between the characters at times is then all the more heartwarming.Simply put, if you liked East Bound and Down you will like Vice Principals. If you like Vice Principals and haven't seen East Bound and Down then make it next on your list - you'll love it. For all the people that don't like the show, that's OK too, it just means that this will become a cult classic."
28,HBO,Mosaic,5056958,"I actually registered on IMDb just to write a review for this series. It starts out looking as if it has potential to be a great who dunnit and ends with more questions than answers.I had trouble keeping track of all the characters because there are so many that you never see. Who the hell is Cameron anyway? And in the last episode, the only interesting well developed character, the cop, isn't even in it. He just disappears.Sharon Stone's character is so obnoxious you don't mind that someone kills her. And by the fourth episode I almost didn't care who really did it. But I had so much time invested in it already I figured let's see what happens.Well nothing. Nothing happens. It's the most unsatisfying ending of any series I've watched. And the biggest red herring they throw at you is never resolved. What was the symbol they keep showing? They make a huge deal out of it and it has absolutely nothing to do with anything.Please don't waste your time! It really is that bad."
29,HBO,Big Love,0421030,"A friend of mine asked me if I had seen ""The show about the guy with three wives,"" and I had no clue which show he was talking about. He told me it was called ""Big Love"" and I should catch it. Well, now having watched the first two seasons, I can confidently say this is the best television show I've seen in years. The polygamy is not even close to what the show's all about-- even though that part is extremely interesting.First off, Bill Paxton is charged with a tough duty-- he's really the backbone of the show, and he is flawless scene after scene after scene. The same can be said of Tripplehorn, Sevigny and Goodwin. Amanda Seyfriend also really shines in a quiet but emotionally conflicted role as the teenage daughter battling religious self-esteem and monogamy vs polygamy for a life path. Douglas Smith demonstrates great promise as a young actor whose character is in a state of constant awkwardness and whose introverted nature is taken to the backseat when a great personal challenge for him begins to arise in the second season.The stories are fantastic, with wonderful characters at every level. Harry Dean Stanton as Roman Grant is an absolute masterclass in acting; his tiny, shriveled exterior does nothing to prevent us from fearing his powerful, commanding leadership role as the so-called prophet of the compound.Boasting plot lines consistently intriguing and aiding in character development rather than mere shock value, it refuses to make overt caricatures out of characters easy to keep one-dimensional. For me personally as an atheist who is fascinated with the study of theology, it's rousing fun to cheer for the polygamist and his loving family. The part that sucks me in the most is definitely the ""right"" decisions characters make, albeit justified with religious convictions. Don't just ""give it a chance""-- watch it and you will love it. It's smart, funny, emotionally impacting and extremely well-written."
30,HBO,Carnivale,0319969,"This show was destined to be the greatest show on Television, it won loads of awards and the cast, writers, directors, art directors, costume designers and every member of the crew deserve a place in the Television Hall of Fame.What was HBO thinking when they canned this masterpiece. It is without doubt the best piece of Televised Artwork to come out of America since Twin Peaks (Go Sampson) and dare I say, The X-Files.I just finished watching the second season and was destroyed when I discovered the show had been axed.Jonesy, Lodz, Sophie the Omega, Brother Justin and the dying Corn Field.BRING IT BACK.By the power of Greyskull I command HBO or any other Network with the balls and brains to give Danial Knauf, Tracey Torme and the Army of Incredible artisans the green light to continue this awe inspiring Feast of Visual Entertainment.Let's create a Carnivale petition on the IMDb.If you want this show back, VOTE HERE!!!YES - Bring it Back.NO - Leave it be."
31,HBO,Flight Of The Conchords,0863046,"To me, this show is bliss. I watched both of the first two episodes aired and am already in love. The genius lies in the delivery. The seriousness of which Bret and Jermaine approach the situation adds a certain amount of wit to every comment made. Pay close attention and the slightest musical references are made, such as Fleetwood Mac's ""love square"". It is the subtlety of the comedy that makes this show stand out above the rest.And as for the musical moments, I think I can speak for if not everyone, then mostly everyone when i say that my inner most thoughts are always in song.kudos Bret and Jermaine for creating a unique clever show that i'll look forward to every week."
32,HBO,Hung,1229413,"I had a chance to watch episodes 1 to 4, though I'm living in Germany without HBO and I have to admit, that this show got me hooked from minute one. It's not only the actors who have convinced me - of course especially Thomas Jane, Jane Adams and Anne Heche. Actually, what I really admire is the tone of this show: it could have gotten so ridiculous, so absurd, but it's just funny and at the same time very serious. You are watching a man's struggle for money in order to get a burnt house rebuilt and to get his children back from their kind-of-strange mum, and it's getting to you. You wish this man, Ray Drecker, all the best and many ""customers"" as well as you wish his pimp, Tanya, that she's getting what she's deserved, a bit of appreciation for what she does. I am watching Thomas Jane's career since the stupid but very entertaining ""Deep Blue Sea"" and I enjoy seeing him in this leading man situation. I am very happy, that HBO has ordered more episodes and I can't wait to see the rest of this season. .. oh, sorry for my bad English :)"
33,HBO,Extras,0445114,"Every so often, England hits the comedic mark and creates a benchmark to which all else must aspire; Monthy Python, Dad's Army, Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and, of course, the simply faultless ""The Office"". The writing team of Gervais and Merchant crafted in that series some of the most achingly funny and desperately well observed depictions of the human condition ever committed to film. ""The Office"" struck a particular chord with me because I have spent most of my adult life in sales and they nailed the highs and lows of that career brilliantly.Moving on then to their new offering; ""Extras"", I am happy to report that the observational skills have not deserted them. This time the central character (Andy Millman) is again played by Ricky Gervais, only, unlike his David Brent character, Millman is astute, caring and worth the time of day. Unforutnately, like Brent, he is also trapped in a spiral of underachievement.Andy Millman is an film extra, a background artiste, who aspires to a real acting role and the central theme of each episode is his quest for a ""line"" in each film in which he appears in the background. Along side him is his (seemingly) only friend, a frustrated thirty something woman, Maggie Jacobs (superbly played by Ashley Jensen), whose sole aim seems to be to find a husband / longterm partner. Add into this mix a chronically crap agent (Merchant himself), a nemesis in the shape of another extra who seems to be getting lines and a liberal sprinkling of cameoing ""A"" list guest stars and you have a wonderful platform on which to build a spankingly funny series.And wow... do they hit a home run! Every second of each episode is deliciously funny and acutely observed. Highlights to look out for are the Ben Stiller/Dodgeball opening weekend grosses scene - the Golly scene in Maggie's apartment - the ""Are you really a Catholic scene"" and, above anything you will have ever seen in a TV comedy, the entire Les Dennis episode.Les Dennis will be lost on Americans but for those of us who have followed his plunging career, you can only weep for this superbly written and judged performance. Pathos doesn't even begin to cover it.Also, anyone who can look at Kate Winslet again without thinking of that ""phone sex"" scene is a better man than me.Please, please, watch ""Extras"". It may, for some, be an acquired taste but once you have that taste, its like a piece of Swiss chocolate - exquisite.And no laugh track either - yay England."
34,HBO,Camelot,1672189,"The mix of Shakespeare's ""The Winter's Tale"" and the story of King Arthur is a new twist on the Lancelot/Guinevere (French) storyline. It would be very refreshing for a King Arthur show not to have the love triangle but I guess you wouldn't have the female audiences watching it if you didn't. Unfortunately with an Arthur that is a whiny brat it's hard to get behind this one. I love the rest of the cast though. Eva Green and Joseph Fiennes are fantastic as well as the rest of the supporting cast. Fiennes giving a more gritty, realistic feeling to Merlin than just an all powerful wizard is also refreshing. If it wasn't for the way that they wrote Arthur and how Bower plays him this would be an absolutely great show."
35,HBO,Room 104,6064882,"At first, I thought I was watching another Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, and I was excited about that. But as the series goes on, I wasn't sure what I was watching anymore. I watched episodes 1-6. These episodes ranged from pretty predictable Twilight Zone-style plots to touching dramas to whatever the hell happened with the cult episode to literally 30 minutes of interpretive dance. So after 6 episodes, I'm calling it quits. I don't think it's a bad thing to question or be surprised about what you're watching, but there's a limit to that. If I'm in the mood for sports, I don't want to see a psychological thriller. If I'm in the mood for sci-fi action, I don't want a Charlie Chaplin silent film. The problem with Room 104 is that you don't know what you're watching until you've watched it (and with some episodes, you still don't know what you watched). It's like committing to watching whatever channel you land on after mashing the buttons on your remote.With that said, the production values are pretty good, there are some good actors, and 1 of the 6 episodes had a twist that surprised me, so I gave it a 3/10."
36,HBO,Vinyl,3186130,"I absolutely loved everything about this series and am so sad it was only one season. In my opinion, it was a work of art. The acting was superb, the story engaging and edgy, and the music was breathtaking. Clearly a labor of love by the creators. I recommend that you ignore the hateful reviews and try it for yourself. Just watched it in 2017 and loved every minute of the story."
37,HBO,Get Smart,0058805,"To review GET SMART is like giving a speech on ""What I think of my Mother-In-Law!  There will NEVER be another Max - even ""Max"" himself couldn't do it in 1995.  GET SMART is a 60's time-capsule, a reminder of a life style that has so long disappeared it hurts to remember!
No matter how many times you see it - its still funny..it will ALWAYS be funny - it even transcends humor. It is something so comfortable and embraceable you can temporarily forget every day to day hassle that may be niggling at you. For those with even longer memories, Maxwell Smart had his embryonic exposure as the store detective ""Glick"" in the Bill Dana show...almost exactly the same character. No matter, the combination of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and the long suffering (and late) Ed Platt were arguably the most charismatic acting trilogy ever screened. Dear old Bernie Kopell as Siegfried, Max's nemesis in CHAOS and David Ketchum as the insanely hidden Agent 13 combined to raise GET SMART to heights will never again be assailed. Probably the only show ever came close to being as fondly remembered is the Adam West/Burt Ward BATMAN series of the same period.Think about it!  How many people in the Western World of most any age have never heard of Max's shoe-phone, the cone of silence? or the phrase ""Would you believe?""   THAT is a measure of the penetration of GET SMART in current society. Along with THE FLINSTONES, our lives have all been enriched by this most enduring of legends!"
38,HBO,Treme,1279972,"As a local who lived here during Katrina, I find this show particularly moving and powerful.There have been so many films, documentaries, novels, etc. about New Orleans, and most tend to sensationalize or to give non-locals what they want or expect to see. This is the most real portrait of the city I've seen, and it does justice to the spirit of the city. Living here is a strange experience because it feels like a small town: you run into the same people again and again; people are always eager to show newcomers where to eat or drink or listen to music; people are very friendly; people do tend to cringe when visitors never stray from Bourbon (even though Bourbon is fun); people do have a fierce loyalty to local bars, restaurants, etc. Simon really captures all of this in the show. I never saw The Wire, but I'm impressed with the style of giving snapshots of the city or characters to build portraits of the people and the atmosphere - particularly the second line parade, John Goodman's character reading the Tulane renewal plan (brought back some painful memories for me personally), the Mardi Gras Indian practice, the reaction of people walking into a house or bar for the first time since the storm and surveying the damage.My main concern for this show: I have no idea how non-New Orleanians will feel about it. So much of my enjoyment of the show is rooted in seeing people I know and finally seeing a director do justice to some of the most wonderful things about this city. But I'm not sure how I would feel if I weren't so emotionally invested in it."
39,HBO,Looking,2581458,"Some folks are complaining that the show seems ""too slow"" or ""is boring"". I disagree completely. I'm much more invested in the characters precisely BECAUSE it's not ""Hollywood slick"". The lines are utterly natural and real to me. Nothing seems ""forced"" or ""acted"". The sex-scenes are frank, but very tasteful and more is implied than ever shown, anyway. The humor is genuine and seems completely spontaneous. I really appreciate this more methodical approach. No, it doesn't represent every single facet of the gay community, but it isn't trying to either. Just the lives and loves of a few guys in San Francisco...that's all. It can't be everything to everyone...and shouldn't try. I love it so far. Hoping it's renewed!!!"
40,HBO,Real Time with Bill Maher,0350448,"Of course, some people are attracted to the unstable. I have to watch this show whenever I notice it is on, even when I find it to be an episode that I have already seen. You are never sure if you should laugh or wince as Bill takes aim at everything ridiculous about America. He even lets himself be ridiculed, which is the mark of a fair commentator. The guests on his shows frequently disagree with him and the show is more fun when they disagree. The first time I really took to Bill's style was watching a show where one of the guests(Andrew Sullivan, I think) slammed a comment of Bill's that they then discussed for a few minutes. The only thing I don't like about the show is that it is too short. Bill frequently has to cut discussions off to make way for other topics, which gives it the feel in pace of PTI. An important show with a perfect home in HBO, where you can actually say what you want to say."
41,HBO,Fraggle Rock,0085017,"Here we have a children's series that creates a world with a totally believable and frighteningly delicate ecology of creatures who really want nothing to do with each other (though they never really say so) but are completely dependent on one another.  A series for children that's unafraid to tackle issues such as death, war, religion, self-sacrifice, self-actualization, and interdependency, all without resorting to ""preachification"" (a term from the series).  The fact that ""Fraggle Rock"" achieved all this *and* kept the tone light and the attitude playful is nothing short of a true miracle.""Fraggle Rock"" has to be my all time favorite series as a kid, and looking back as an adult, I realize how ambitious it was. Leave it to Jim Henson to build an entire world that was so believable, you wanted to visit it. I am certain that this was a once in a lifetime thing.  There will *never* be another series with this much imagination or dedication to its young audience.  Too bad, as today we need this series' gentle messages more so than ever.Recently, a few episode of ""Fraggle Rock"" were released on video.  For many of us, these are the only ones we have access to, and I believe that a *real* ""Fraggle Rock"" fan should have been put in charge of which episodes were preserved.  Instead, while volume three (entitled ""the Fraggles Search and Find"") has the two greatest episodes of all time in my opinion, the remaining tapes' episodes appear to have been chosen at random.  Get tape three if you can!"
42,HBO,Bored to Death,1255913,"This show is probably the best thing on American TV right now, it doesn't try to be in your face unusual but it just is because of its slow burning pace, great offbeat sense of humor, while you won't catch yourself bursting with laughter at cheap humor that many shows rely on, BTD has some of the funniest and most SUBTLE written dialog that seems to be a privilege of British shows. Its a brilliantly written show with characters and story lines that are painfully endearing. And if you like me haven't been entirely convinced in the first episode, please don't give up on it, it's one of those shows that grow on you and you catch yourself watching BTD again and again. It did seem at first as something specifically catered for Brooklyn hipsters, but it gives a great background for the stories and if you live in Brooklyn you'll appreciate glimpses of your neighborhood (especially Williamsburg). All around a funny and pleasant way to spend half an hour!"
43,HBO,Animals,4953128,"Some of the reviews for this show, are...misguided? I mean, the first review said you should watch ""The Simpsons"" if you want a funny animated comedy. A bit outdated. ""Animals"" has its own charm and a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, at least for me. You'll be able to recognize a lot of the voices from the alt-comedy world. Off the top of my head there's Nathan Fielder, Nick Kroll, Jason Mantzoukas, etc. I've yet to watch the third episode, but the first two were unlike anything I had seen before. It's a blend of crude humor, surprising emotion, and outright funniness. Yes, the animation is not good. But, it is purposefully NOT GOOD. The whole point is these animals are caricatures of humanity, which is obvious if you pay even a little attention to the dialogue. These rats aren't suppose to seem like life-like rats, because they aren't, they're just an embodiment of human emotion and stupidity.All in all, this show is not for everyone. That's obvious. It might even take you a few viewings to really understand what the creators are hoping to achieve, but its a great show with vast potential and I hope HBO keeps it running. Also, ""The Simpsons"" is whatever, go with ""Rick and Morty"" if you want an awesome animated comedy that isn't this one."
44,HBO,The Kids in the Hall,0096626,"All of all the sketch comedy shows I have seen, The Kids In The Hall is the best damn comedy show ever. The Kids are outstanding and they are very funny and it was a shame that their show ended. I love them!! I was almost into tears when the show ended. I hope that someday they can do another reunion show. The coolest sketch comedy show i have seen in years."
45,HBO,In Treatment,0835434,"I think it should be understood, that therapy is not always the cliff-hanger that these episodes are. But, if you made a show that was truly realistic to what occurs in therapy, no one would watch it. So I feel the writers/producers of ""In Treatment"" made the smart move in focusing on the aspects of therapy (psychoanalysis, to be precise) that are most riveting; these tend to be issues of transference and counter-transference. The Friday supervisions/treatments that Paul receives provide vital clues to keep an eye out for in the subsequent sessions that he has in the following week. In the most recent episode (2-5-08), Paul is seen to be projecting onto Alex his own feelings towards his marriage by telling alex that he's probably known these marital concerns were at a ""boiling point"" for some time. This is a small example of the attention to detail that the writers/producers have paid to the realities of therapy; and if they did this without a psych consult, all the more credit to them.Lets not forget that this is a television show. It can't be a perfect portrayal of the reality of the therapeutic environment. Lets ALSO remember that therapists are not perfect people. They can be idiots who foolishly leave medicine in their office bathroom cabinets; they can project their own issues into a session; and they can clog their toilets up, resulting in an argument with a client over boundaries (Laura, week2). Paul is being portrayed as an adept psychoanalyst with issues of self-worth that were probably never thoroughly analyzed during his training. When the narcissistic thrill of being a gifted therapist wears off, everything starts to make its way to the surface.Kudos to HBO on a well-done series."
46,HBO,Tell Me You Love Me,0809497,"Some people will have heard about this show because of its controversy. I did myself. Admittedly, I was intrigued because of the promise of sexual content on TV - HBO, nonetheless. Having now seen the first episode of ""Tell Me You Love Me"", I know what the show is actually about.If you're expecting ""porn TV"", think again. Yes, the show does have several moments of sexual contact, both oral and intercourse, but when they occur it is anything but arousing - instead it's uncomfortably realistic - down to moments of climax, the show does not flinch from showing the explicit.But soon enough, if you actually watch the show, you'll realise that this isn't what the show is about. Many people will make the mistake of thinking this show is about sex, but it's about relationships, and how sex is used to shield us from the problems of our relationships.Three different couples are the focus each dealing with different problems; one tries desperately for a baby, one's physical relationship is intense but unreliable in terms of commitment, and one married couple struggles to deal with the lack of sex in their lives. Both the issues raised in the show and the dialogue are uncannily realistic, to the point that you can't help but compare the relationships in the show with your own, and this can sometimes make for uncomfortable viewing - I'd strongly advise against watching this with your partner."
47,HBO,Togetherness,3061830,"This show has exceeded my expectations on every level. It has some hilariously funny moments, but is much, much more than a comedy.Covering friendships, working relationships and romantic ones, as well as those magical relationships without a label, this show is not afraid to be dark, and delve into the (sometimes) depressing realities of marriage/any long-term relationship.I found it pulling at my heartstrings more and more each episode, as my understanding of the characters grew organically. None of the situations felt forced or particularly unrealistic, and always relatable.I can only surmise that any negative reviewers don't have much relationship experience, because to me, there is so much to recognise in these characters and their bonds. The writing is superb. The acting is even better, all the main characters blew me away. Mark Duplass, with an amazing portrayal of a man struggling with the fallacy of being normal, Melanie Lynskey, as the wife and mother who wants more, and especially manchild Steve Zissis, playing a complex funny man. Cannot recommend it enough! Would usually leave room in a review for the downsides, but I can't really think of any.. please watch it! (I really want more seasons!!)"
48,HBO,The Comeback,0434672,"I have just had the pleasure of seeing the entire season of The Comeback. I cannot believe the poor reception this series has had with the viewing public of America. The writing and performances from all concerned are outstanding. The situations are extreme, but then how many of us have the insight into the makings of a TV sitcom. Even so, it always seems believable. Kudos to Kudrow for creating one of the most likable, infuriating, delicious, yet tragic characters to grace TV for a long while. And special mention to Lance Barber for instilling Paulie G with so much venom and hatred to create one of the most loathsome. So many good moments crammed into each episode this series demands repeat viewing. I caught an ep. of Friends shortly afterwards, and could not watch Phoebe (or indeed any of the contrived, poorly scripted nonsense I had so previously enjoyed) without seeing Big Red behind the drippy one-liners. I will most definitely watch it again and again when it comes to the UK.(To Tom Selleck on the phone: ""Well, maybe I'll call you again if they decide to revive my big beaver..."")"
49,HBO,Summer Heights High,0934320,"Chris Lilley is a comedic genius. His first series, ""We Can Be Heroes"" was a excellent slice of humour and realistic satire. He has pulled it off again with Summer Heights High, a mockumentary following three different people who attend the high school Summer Heights High.We have Jonah, probably the most loved character, a 13 year old boy from Tonga who has some big issues. He has no respect for his teachers and he constantly swears and graffitis. His only joy seems to come from Gumnut College where is is developing his own personal story.Ja'mie is a transfer student from Hillford Girls Grammar School, an extremely upper class school which is totally different from SHH, which is your average public school. She befriends a group of girls and is constantly looking down on everyone and trying to organize events that will lift school spirit.Finally, there is Mr. G (my personal favourite), an eccentric and very feminine Drama teacher. His methods are odd, he is extremely full of himself and his new musical ""Annabel: The Musical"" is about ecstasy.We follow these characters and all their misfortunes and aspirations. The show is always funny but it is always realistic. It captures everything perfectly from the state of public schools (no offense), students with ADD, what people from private school are like and how teachers cope with hardships. Chris Lilley is an immensely talented man and I cannot wait to see what he does next.5/5"
50,HBO,The Adventures of Tintin,0179552,"This animated TV is the adaptation of the famous Hergé's comic books. Generally, it makes a good adaptation. Some episodes do better than others, but the adaptation is reasonable. Even so, the books are clearly better and more complete. In the animated TV series, they usually miss lots of parts that should be included.I own some of these comic books. I used to watch this TV series as much as I used to read the books I have back then, but I always liked the books better. Anyway, about the TV series, I used to watch it both spoken in french and dubbed in Italian (on Rai Uno, in the case of the Italian dubbed version). Of course that I prefer the french version for the simple fact of being the original version.The stories of Tintin are (the majority of them, apart one or another) quite entertaining, thrilling, great fun, simple and delightful. They are, without a doubt, good adventures with classic humor. It should satisfy most everyone: children, teenagers and adults.The characters are interesting: Tintin is a cool and intelligent chap; his dog Milou is really cute and fluffy; Captain Haddock is grumpy, sarcastic and humorous; Professor Tournesol is the eternal distracted who doesn't listen and understand a word of what the others are saying and, as such, always understands everything very badly. There are also the two police detective twins (Dupond and Dupont), who are absolutely stupid, silly and hilarious.The song that plays during the opening credits and the final credits is great."
51,HBO,Mr. Show with Bob and David,0112084,"If you want to see one of the most groundbreaking skit comedy shows ever, look no further than Mr. Show. Wow. Each episode is a work of art, every skit amazingly flows into the next. Filmed skits, flow into live skits, back and forth... absolutely amazing. Also, if you want to see some great character work, look no further. Bob Odenkirk and David Cross are some of todays best comedic character actors', and the supporting cast is unbelievable. Also the fact that it was on HBO, the show was able to get away with more. Its so great. They only made 30 episodes, and now they are on hiatus while filming the First ""Mr. Show"" movie. What a great show."
52,HBO,Todd McFarlane's Spawn,0118475,"I agree with what many reviewers said and I wont rehash the story line anymore - many folks have done so already.What I'd like to add is that HBO Cable Networks did a wonderful thing in showing this as a weekly series. I was glued to the television weekly at midnight - not just me but all of my friends as well. I don't care what I was doing, I HAD to watch this. We all loved this animated working of Spawn. The animation was crisp, the storytelling was adult and intelligent, the vocal casting was superb. This is what adult animation and comic book adaptation was about. The first season was better than the second one to me but both were groundbreaking.What I disliked more than anything -- was the feature film of ""Spawn"". It did not hold a candle to this series and just ruined what was already done. Sad thing, HBO hasn't re-shown repeats of this and they should. And HBO hasn't produced & adapted other comics, which it should be doing along these lines. There are many production lessons here as well as a great adaptation lesson. Todd MacFarlane's creation is the best here. I hope they show it again, release a DVD if so, do not miss this. Be forewarned - adult themes run through this version. The first season is NOT for the kiddies or a PG-13 oriented. It is dark, it is wonderful and it is the world of Spawn as it should be seen and interpreted."
53,HBO,Enlightened,1509004,"The show is about one very flawed woman's struggle to become a better and healthier person. She's clearly lost, but dedicated and passionate in a way which makes you admire her and be annoyed by her at the same time. The show does a neat trick of manipulating the viewer into alternatively mocking her because of her naivete and flakiness, and cheering for her out of empathy, both back and forth within single episodes. You come to expect her to crash and burn in a tragic and comedic fashion. Yet in the end, she claims small victories of enlightenment that put all of us in touch with our humanity and teach us a little bit about growth. The show is not preachy, yet makes its points poignantly and powerfully. I'm excited with anticipation as to where the show may go and hope it is renewed despite the poor ratings so far. Definitely my favorite new show of the season."
54,HBO,Hello Ladies,2378794,"I must admit to having high expectations of this, and I will confirm it did not let me down!This is Steve Merchant at his best. After reading mostly mixed reviews, I wanted to give my humble opinion as to why this show is so enjoyable.If you have been a fan of Merchant since his XFM days you will see his comedy stylings splashed across this series and he nails his awkward, gawky character to a tee.The penny-pinching persona, cringe-worthy attempts to hit on the ladies and all round geeky- vibe is exactly what this comedy genius is about. It's witty, awkward and filled with laughs whilst infused with an pseudo-emotional undertone about his overall bad luck with the female persuasion. The cinematography, intro clips and soundtracks have an 'entourage' style and are fantastic and really add to quality of this show. The friends of Merchant in the show compliment him - and the series greatly - and overall I'm really enjoying this series so farViewers who may not like this style of comedy or S.Merch as a comic writer will most likely disagree with my views and I can completely understand as it is not for everyones taste, but those who indulge in Merchants style will greatly appreciate this series."
55,HBO,Life's Too Short,1641247,"Gervais can be annoying. Despite this, I am a fan of almost everything he's done.The Office was outstanding and Extras wasn't bad either.I kept seeing a few negative reviews about this and for some reason it passed me by.Recently, I got the chance to see the series. I wasn't expecting much.Boy, was I wrong! There are so many laugh out loud moments in this series. Soooooo many. At the end of the day, that's what comedy is for...no? Warwick Davis is brilliant in this and shows what a fine actor he really is. He essentially plays a David Brent character in a mockumentary..but really, really well.Some have criticized the show for being offensive towards smaller people. They just don't get it.The fact that the main character is little becomes fairly irrelevant. He's just an odious toad! The dumb secretary and the manic depressive accountant are also hilarious characters.The cringe factor of Gervais' work is always high but this series has a cringe factor through the roof. It can be uncomfortable to watch at times, but you can't take your eyes off it.I loved it.A measly 7.7 on here is probably almost as funny as the show.Watch it and love it."
56,HBO,The Brink,3216586,"I am having the best time watching ""The Brink."" It's a funny, clever, fast moving half hour of t.v. If you're not paying attention, you'll miss so many great lines. Tim Robbins is hysterical as Secretary of State. Reminds me of Charlie Wilson; womanizer, drinker, but smart as heck. Jack Black is not my favorite comedian but he is winning me over in this series. John Larrouquette plays the fanatical religious ambassador to perfection. Pablo Schreiber is a lovable screw up. I don't think of Esai Morales as a comedic actor but he plays comedy really well. I could go on and on about each character so I'll conclude with this. Each and everyone of their performances knocks it out of the park. I applaud the writers of this great show. If this series is not picked up for a second season, I'll be terribly disappointed."
57,HBO,The Ricky Gervais Show,1553644,"This show is brilliant. It is funny. The fact that one of the reviewers on here downed this show and then, in all seriousness, recommended that you go watch ""two and a half men"" for good comedy should tell you all that you need to know about that reviewer's tastes. It's not about whether you find Ricky Gervais funny. It's all about Karl. I would say, if you have above average intelligence you will find this funny. If you have below average intelligence, then by all means go watch some of that comedy genius, Charlie Sheen. Watch this show. You will love it. And if you don't, well, there is something wrong with you."
58,HBO,Ja'mie: Private School Girl,3173854,"I have seen some ordinary reviews for Ja'mie ( added the apostrophe in year 8 ) - but guess they must be from people who take the whole set-up seriously and can't get their head round a middle aged comedian doing a wonderful job as an over-the-top snobby head girl ! Benny Hill did some similar skits years ago ; that likewise were very funny ; Ja'mie is a combination of slap-stick - Dame Edna, over-the-top great Aussie humour taking a wonderful swipe at many of the US college type shows were the spiteful blonde beauty loses her boyfriend to the plain new girl who turns out to be a glamour. This is a show that aging dad ( me ) and teen daughter both love and has us both cracking up in parts. e.g. The flat chested Ja'mie on being targeted by some more developed 'borders' at the school ; ""Why don't you go cook your dinner, I bet your having Lesbianese"""
59,HBO,Vice (HBO),2782710,"If you don't think that seeing video of the decapitated head of a teenage suicide bomber doesn't alter your view of reality you should really give this a look. Yes, the graphic imagery not allowed on traditional news networks is...shattering...(that's the only word i can think of). However, the real reason to watch this show is that it's the new front of investigative journalism. Real people going into real situations instead of repeating, and re-repeating AP news-wire bullet points. Or worse, spending hours reading tweets on a channel that's supposed to be 24/7 news. No i don't care about CatLov3r69's opinion on the scientific applications of stem cell research.In addition, if you have ever written for a newspaper, even a school newspaper or taken a journalism class or have common sense you know that the only good way to tell a story is to tell both sides. We don't see that in news much these days. Nobody is making an effort to track down lieutenants of Taliban for a non-pixlized interview. These people are. Granted i'm only one episode in but if the rest of them are as interesting/sad/involved as the first one, I'm really looking forward to it. It shows people as people; complicated and confused."
60,HBO,How to Make It in America,1299365,"Yes, Mark Wahlberg is executive producer on this show and yes, the show runs on HBO. Yes it's about 30-something guys that happen to like to party and try to make a living. Still this show is not like Entourage. It's as different as NYC and L.A. are. Entourage is about glamour, money and Hollywood. HMIA is about the big city life, it's about the Big Apple, about young people trying to achieve something. It's more ""down to earth"" than Entourage and not as spectacular at first. The pacing is much slower and you have less sex, models and rock'n roll. But you DO have a great cast, authentic people in the most realistic capture of young adults living in Manhattan. It's a love letter to the city and the people who live there. It's a great show with likable characters, great dialogue, great cinematography and good and witty humor. This is like Sex and the City for guys. But less superficial. I really dig this show. Let's hope HBO does too!"
61,HBO,Luck,1578887,"Although the first episode of this series was painful to get through, each episode thereafter gets better and better. After an inaudible beginning ""Luck"" just might careers and an industry.As a horse lover and long time fan of Nick Nolte, I wanted to like this show but the first episode was loaded with track jargon, slang, broken English, low quality sound, and heavy accents. There also wasn't much seen of Nolte in the first episode. Fortunately I had the first 3 episodes programmed on the DVR so I had a vested interest in at least watching these recorded episodes. By the third episode I enabled closed caption so that I could follow better. I wish I had not deleted the first episode because I would have re-watched it in closed caption. This first episode is chock-full of information and innuendos, probably why it was so difficult to get through.This is unfortunate because the series gets better with each episode and I'm sure the lack of clarity in the beginning has meant the series has lost viewers. Viewers should know, however, that Nolte and Dustin Hoffman are not in this series for nothing. Nolte, whose notorious good looks is now replaced with grey hair and lots of character is a nostalgic owner/trainer brokenhearted over the past with a keen sense of a good race horse. Hoffman starts out stiff and almost out of place, but then his character is out of place due to a series of previous events.Integrity and love is really what this series is about. The four gamblers, you find, after a few episodes, really love each other. The jockeys love to ride, Nolte loves horses, and Hoffman loves his right hand man. What seems evident is that some day soon, all of these characters will come together in an as yet unknown common experience.The sound quality of this series is perhaps the only flaw and it's a big flaw. This seems to be common in today's movies and series. You understood every word Bogart said in Casablanca. It is called ""projection."" Old school directors and actors knew about this. I don't know what happened or why contemporary films ignores the need for people to hear and understand what characters are saying. It's almost as if they think this some type of technique but it isn't and is surely the reason, perhaps the only reason that this show may not get the viewers it deserves. Despite this,I rate this series high which says just how good this series could be.If you love horses, racing, Nolte, Hoffman or Farina, I highly recommend this series, despite the audio issues which I hope, given a second season, they fix. If you love a good race, which there seems to be one in almost every episode, this series is also for you. ""Luck,"" given the chance, may revive the horse racing industry. It reminds you of just why this sport is the ""sport of kings."" Hope they will fix the audio, first time I can remember sound being such a ""handicap."""
62,HBO,Intelligence,0845746,"I recently stumbled on this show by accident while doing an IMDb search on an actor. Being your typical insular American I had never heard of 'Intelligence' or even the CBC, but I have to say that after watching the first two seasons I am very impressed. Sadly, rumors are that the show has been canceled so I suppose some things about Americans and Canadians are the same; 'The Wire' was never appreciated by viewers here either. The show is an extremely smart (or intelligent; get it? hah hah hah) approach to the world of espionage and organized crime. Shows that I've seen in the past dealing with these topics were most often disappointing in their shallowness and over-simplification of a complex and difficult world. As an example, one of my pet peeves is that often when you watch a show about the CIA you would think that there are exactly 10 people working for the agency. 5 covert operatives and 5 analysts/technical operators. Studio execs will tell you they compress the number of characters so that audiences don't get confused, but to me the whole thing usually just comes off fake. ""Meet Joe, he's our computer/linguistic/explosives expert who joined the Navy Seals after getting his Phd's from Harvard and is now a US senator."" Fake.Not so with 'Intelligence'. The show has a large and diverse cast, allowing the show to explore the facets of characters in a more organic way. Of course, a large cast also means some characters you would like to see more of just can't get the screen time you would like but that's the trade off and, in my opinion, it's well worth it.I've always been fascinated with the spy world, all those secrets within secrets makes for fascinating mental games, and the back story of Canada attempting to create their own international spy ring provides great opportunities for story lines. Add to that the very realistic portrayal of life in a drug kingpin syndicate and there is always plenty of interesting plots developing, often independently, in each episode.Ian Tracey plays Jimmy Reardon, a weed drug smuggler who has built quite the little empire in Canada. Jimmy has done quite well for his ""family"", but the difficulties of success are beginning to make his life difficult. His life plays out like that of any successful business exec; constant meetings all day, inept employees, and logistical nightmares of running an organization with hundreds of employees. Contrary to popular images of drug dealers Jimmy is quiet, reasoned, not prone to fits of anger, and prefers to make well informed decisions that avoid violence whenever possible. Eventually, circumstances conspire to bring Jimmy into contact with Mary Spalding, played by Klea Scott.Mary is, in basic personality, much like Jimmy. Quiet, tough, and highly capable, she is currently running the Canadian Organized Crime Unit, but is being tapped for a leadership position in the newly forming (or organizing, I'm not really sure which) Canadian intelligence service CSIS. Working in an old-boys network along side some of the worst vipers you've ever seen, Mary is a human intelligence specialist. She recruits confidential informants and, soon, spies. Events unfold that allow Mary to recruit Jimmy as what may possibly be the agencies most valuable asset. Occasionally their interests merge and Jimmy and Mary can help one another, though they maintain a careful cat and mouse routine between the two of them, not really trusting the other.The truly fascinating thing (for me) to watch is how the CSIS agency builds itself into a real force to be reckoned with, and the ethical dilemmas that begin to unfold as they succeed. At first many of Mary's recruits approach her, or are in situations where they can help one another, but as soon as her higher-ups realize she's making it happen specific requests start pouring in and the decisions get harder. The agency begins to resort to blackmail and extortion to accomplish it's tasks. It raises interesting points. The CIA has (often rightly) taken a lot of heat here in the states for its actions in the past, but those same critics want intelligence agencies to be affective in preventing the next domestic attack on our nation. There is a definite moral and ethical trade-off that takes place with effectiveness at some point, and the show does a great job of highlighting that.I won't bother going into the other characters on the show. As I said, there are a lot of them, but I'll say that most are well created and interesting. The show has enough action to keep the pace up in most episodes and the filming quality is decent though a bit of a step down if you are used to American production values. Definitely worth watching if you get the opportunity."
63,HBO,Getting On,2342652,"I've just listened to an NPR Fresh Air interview with Mark Olsen and Will Scheffer, who were constantly referred to throughout as the ""creators"" of Getting On. They happily accepted this accolade and proceeded, with truly nauseating sincerity, to explain how the stories in the series were based on their experiences caring for their respective elderly mothers, which, we're given to understand, is why it's all so real, so poignant, so personal. Curious then that 95% of the US adaptation of Getting On is identical - and I'm talking line for line, if not quite word for word - to the UK original, created by the wonderful Jo Brand. The 5% that's different is where the US version blunts the humour, misses the point, or merely adds lame phoney-sounding sitcom punchlines to otherwise achingly funny-sad scenes. Maybe Olsen and Scheffer had identical experiences to Brand, and maybe they just forgot to write it down first. Or maybe they actually believe they've added something of value to Brand's work. Or maybe they're just ****s."
64,HBO,Doll & Em,2561882,"The 10-ep second season just ended, so it's a good time to be catching up; both seasons are still available on demand. S1 is quite entertaining: Em (a successful actress not unlike Emily Mortimer herself) invites her best friend, Doll, to come and work for her in LA after a devastating breakup, then finds herself being upstaged by Doll, who people (including Susan Sarandon and John Cusack, playing themselves) really seem to take to and who can cry on cue (a job skill Em's never mastered). Friendship gradually gives way to frenmityS2 is truly brilliant: Doll and Em, reconciled after a falling out, collaborate on a play, which, from what little we get to see, seems heavily influenced by Pinter and Ionesco. Mortimer and Dolly Wells, who really have been friends since childhood, have an amazing rapport; the best scenes involve their wary relationship with the two actresses they've engaged to play themselves, Olivia Wilde and Evan Rachel Wood. Scatty Doll and conflicted Em are wonderful, complex characters, and the series reaches a level of subtlety and spontaneity that's rarely encountered in cable comedy; at its best, ""Doll & Em"" has the feel of really good live theater. Standout scenes, IMHO: a brief glimpse of what seems like an amazing production of ""The Tempest"" aboard a barge on a London canal (Doll plays Ariel), Em totally fails to have it all as she tries to carry on a bubbly phone interview while her young son's standing a few inches away yelling, ""I want pizza!"""
65,HBO,Jim Henson's the Storyteller,0092383,"This is the best television series for children (and adults) ever. John Hurt is a great actor, with many excellent performances over many years, but he was born to play the storyteller. The scripts for almost every episode are superb pieces of craftsmanship, and the productions run the gamut of the emotions, being alternately funny, sad, happy, exciting, and always hauntingly beautiful. It is hard to pick a best episode from so many excellent contenders, but ""The Soldier and Death"", with its timeless pathos, is unbeatable. It is a series to watch with your children, over and over again."
66,HBO,Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales For Every Child,0111996,I love this show. I grew up watching it and the inclusivity is wonderful. The twist on the fairytales makes it so relatable to many and I believe that to be very important. I currently watch this show with my son and he loves all of the songs in it
67,HBO,Angry Boys,1596589,"After initial disappointment I found this series to hit something above the normal. As the stories developed I realised I was not watching Lilley but watching entirely authentic characters. He is a great actor, writer and commenter on society. The characters are like from a modern Ibsen play; good characters but not necessarily of good character. As the narratives slowly piece together (and it is a very gradual process) something emerged for me that was close to the sublime; a humanity that is more important than the comedic values, a sincerity that is more valuable than the dramatic qualities and a genuine compassion for the characters. I am so happy I stayed with it and watched the series in it's entirety. The emotional gratification in the latter episodes had me overwhelmed at times."
68,HBO,The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,1356380,"When I heard about this show being airing on HBO, I was thrilled. My father had read several of the books and loved them (I have just started the first book). Although, from the first moments of the show I was still a bit skeptical. But when Mma opens her detective agency, the writing becomes some of the best I've seen on TV in years. There is a perfect mix between seriousness and fabulous humor.Mma is a clever, witty woman, while her secretary and hairdresser add nothing more than many wonderful laughs. This show has fantastic characters played by wonderful actors.I can only hope that this show stays on for many years to come!"
69,HBO,Family Tree,2340036,"Stumbled onto HBO's half-hour comedy ""Family Tree"" and watched the first three (of 8 ordered so far) on demand last night. VERY funny, especially 1 & 2. 3 slipped just a bit. Am looking forward to 4 later tonight. I believe they are showing all shows to date tomorrow. Catch up. May not be your cup of tea, but o man, if it is you are in for a treat. In some ways this may be pure comedy but I suspect it is a takeoff on the couple of genealogy shows that were popular the last couple of years. The humor is the usual Brit TV humor but given an original boost by reminding us how convoluted our current life is by having us go along on the journey as ""facts"" about our ancestry are uncovered leading first one direction and then abruptly swinging away at 90 degrees or 180 degrees leaving us no more informed about the ""reality"" of our past but thoroughly amused by the commingling of what is, what might be and what might have been. Highly recommended for anyone but especially those engaged in ancestry study at any level."
70,HBO,John From Cincinnati,0814164,"I am fascinated by this show. I have tried a number of times explaining to people what it is about, and I find it difficult. If I had to sum it up in one word I would say ""redemption"". This whole family is so screwed up and John seems to be there to help them heal, but in the most bizarre way! This has now become THE show that my husband and I have to watch each week. My only complaint is about the language. I realize that it is part of the character development, but I think I would still watch without every other word being an F-bomb. I hope the show catches on and people watch, but I fear a lot of people won't get it or will think is it too much work because it does require some thought. That's what I like about it, though."
71,HBO,Lucky Louie,0460619,"In no way is it supposed to be groundbreaking like Six Feet Under, The Sorpranos, or any other HBO programming. Lucky Louie is a sitcom that is filmed, and can be shown, on HBO. They intentionally aren't trying to break the box here, folks; that's the point. I am looking forward to this show because I am sick and tired of the generic, pansy, overly formulaic, and frankly unfunny sitcom shows on network TV (and by this I don't mean My Name Is Earl, The Office, or Arrested Development, but of the Freddy, Dharma and Greg variety). This show will be a breath of fresh air and will give me a great night of comedy (Entourage, Lucky Louie and Tourgasm). I can't wait.Also, I'm sad to report that cast member Jim Norton might not make season 2 because of his battle with AIDS. I'm currently watching his puppy and refilling his broth bowl. Thoughts and prayers."
72,HBO,Da Ali G Show,0241088,"Ali G comes from Staines, and his larger than life obsession with Staines, drugs and all things youth like will make him a huge hit.Take a dose of Goodness Gracious Me, a dollop of Louis Therioux, a whole lot of a gangster rapper attitude, mixed with a quantity of recreational drugs and no fear of saying what he thinks to get Ali G.If you can hang up your hang ups and chill out with the TV Ali G will have you rolling around even if like me your well past the obvious youth market audience.Ali G has several characters, taking on the persona of a dumb rapper, he deliberately misinterprets his interviewees with such style and conviction that they seem to really believe him and have to climb down to the kindergarten level.His apparent naivety as he says to the man from the home office with a display of narcotics ""it's not as if it's illegal is it?""  (The poor man had no idea what to say or where to turn.) and the skill with which he brings down the top dog from the FBI whom he takes literally whilst making a figurative comment about doing a hypothetical crime.  Suggesting that is was not such a good idea to talk about the job whilst the cameras were on.Behind it all is a great talent who enjoys performing his art as much as I do watching it."
73,HBO,Little Britain USA,0936458,"I have never seen this show or any of this groups' previous shows. I'd never even heard of them, although it seems now that they have been around more than a few years. I'll say in advance that I enjoy British humor, especially Monty Python & Tracey Ullman. I enjoy anything funny & well made, regardless of where it's from. When I found this show listed on HBO OnDemand I popped some popcorn & took over the couch.I nearly died laughing. That was just the first 5 minutes. I had to stop it a few times because I laughed so hard I missed some of it & had to back it up. Watching this program felt like I was making a new friend, someone that would happily be in my life forever. I want more. I NEED MORE.To me, this show is Kids In The Hall meets Monty Python with Reno 911 sprinkled on top, but DIRTY funny too. Funny British Comedy! Funny Comedy for any country.I've watched the Little Britain USA twice more & sat down to write it up here, which I've NEVER done before. I am sure there will be some who disagree with my initial feelings for this show after my first viewing, but that's some people for you! Some people have a sense of humor, some don't. And I stand by my warning...Go to the bathroom before you watch this show. I wish someone had warned me."
74,HBO,The Life & Times of Tim,0950701,"The only reason I even signed up and got a user profile on IMDb was so I could spread the word about this show. It is truly one of the funniest and most entertaining shows I've ever seen. WATCH IT!! Not only is it extremely funny, but the story line sucks you in. Each show consists of two fifteen minute segments and within a 30 seconds, the story completely draws you in. My wife said that the show is akin to an animated version of Curb Your Enthusiasm and she's right! The voices fit the characters perfectly and each charter is developed in a very believable way. I can't recommend this show enough!! Check it out! As far as animated shows, it blows South Park and Family Guy out of the water."
75,HBO,Profugos,1941928,"An excellent HBO series set in Chile that follows in the tradition of other well received efforts, most notably, ""Epitafios I and II"" shot in Argentina. ""Profugos"" is worth watching because it shows the best of Chilean talent in action. The premise of the series is a drug deal that misfires. Cocaine is brought from Bolivia to Chile to be shipped from there overseas. The group involved is the Ferragut family controlled from prison by Kika, the matriarch. Her right hand man, Salamanca is a heartless criminal, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Salamanca's troubles go back to the Pinochet era. Vicente Feragut, the son of the woman in jail, must take a second role in the deal. The other members are, Mario Moreno, a man without scruples and an undercover policeman, Tegui.The processed drug comes to Chile aboard a gasoline truck. After crossing the border, the next stop is to get the cocaine in wine bottles to be exported. The operation is extremely professional. The initial drop off point was Iquique in the North of Chile, but then, plans are changed to Valparaiso, where a supporting team of the Ferraguts are in place to see that everything is transfer to a merchant ship. Unknown to Tegui, the Ferraguts have three snipers in place, and the police is undercover at the drop site waiting for them at the pier where a bloody battle ensues. The following chapters show to what extent these criminals will go in their fight against the forces that are following their steps. The direction is shared by Chilean Pablo Larrain, and Jonathan Jakubowicz from Venezuela. The vision of the writing team composed by Josefina Hernandez, Pablo Illanes, Mateo Iribarren and Pablo Videla, makes exciting television. With the resources of HBO, the end result is one of the best series about power, drug trafficking and law enforcement.The four principals do a wonderful job. Francisco Reyes, Nestor Cantillana, Luis Gnecco, and Benjamin Vicuna, a promising young actor whose career has expanded to other international films. The supporting cast is excellent as well, notably, Claudia Di Girolamo, Angelica Castro, Antonia Zegers, Blanca Lewin, Amparo Noguera. The beauty of the country comes through in the great cinematography by Sergio Armstrong that photographs the action throughout Chile in spectacular locations."
76,HBO,Funny or Die Presents,1556078,"Funny or Die Presents is the new comedy series from HBO, which would basically be the same type of content you would see on Funny or Die. Since it doesn't allow you to rate the segments on TV, it's a mixed bag of some funny sketches, as well as some that are just plain awful.Will Ferrell launched his popular comedy video website in 2007. In that short time, it's already been producing some of the funniest videos on the internet, that is when it's funny. That is only half of Funny or Die.There is a certain process to Funny or Die. After watching the video, viewers have the option of giving it a good rating (Funny) or a bad rating (Die) and there is a meter displaying the percentage of people who rated it Funny. It's just like Rotten Tomatoes, but with comedy sketches. The website of course has more Die than Funny, but you don't have to watch them.I really like how the show is set up like a half-hour television network with 2-5 minute programs, like SCTV has done in the past. The show has some great retro credits and the Steve Tom is very funny when he introduces the segments.Does any of this sound funny to you?Drunk History: A drunk person (Jen Kirkman) retells a notable event in history, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, with celebrities mouthing her words. Lincoln (Will Ferrell), Frederick Douglass (Don Cheadle) and Mary Todd Lincoln (Zooey Deschanel) were part of the reenactment. This could be interesting for them to get big names to be part of this. I would even say that it was mildly amusing, but it went on for far too long. I might not have sat through the whole thing on the site so.....low Funny.Safety Saw: A mock infomercial shows a new safety feature on a power saw. As long as a hamster in a wheel keeps moving, the saw will stop as soon as it makes contact. He demonstrates using a hot dog, followed by his penis. I think you can see where this goes. It's disgusting and not funny at all. Die!Designated Driver: A sober man (Paul Scheer) picks up his drunk friend (Rob Riggle) from a bar; chaos ensues. If only for how crazy Rob Riggle acts in this, it's the best of the episode. Funny!Space Baby: Baby in space. Baby has to save Fred Willard. WTF!!! This sketch felt like filler and a colossal waste of Fred Willard's comedic abilities. Die! Die! Die!Overall, it's a very low-brow show and there's a chance that it could get very funny over the next 11 episodes. If you enjoy a movie like Step Brothers, I guarantee you will get something out of this."
77,HBO,Project Greenlight,0299368,"Network: Bravo; Genre: Documentary, reality; Content Rating: TV-14 (for language); Available: on DVD; Classification: Contemporary (star range: 1 - 4); Season Reviewed: Season 3 (""Feast"") After an internet contest where aspiring writers and directors submit their work, producers Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Chris Moore choose from this well of untapped talent to give someone their big break in the film business. Real documentary cameras follow the making of the movie from pre-production and scraping of finances to dealing with tight schedules and difficult actors in production to the post-production editing and screenings. The thrills and the monotony. ""Project Greenlight"" is back. The movie this season: ""Feast"", a self-referential monster movie which the enthusiastically wound-up half of the scriptwriting team, Marcus Dunstan, frighteningly describes as ""Evil Dead meets Die Hard"".A lot has changed for season 3. With the ""Greenlight"" movies not making any money it has shifted into survival mode this time choosing to make a marketable crowd-pleaser people might actually see. For this entry Miramax has moved the show from HBO to basic cable's Bravo where the obscenities are blanked out and a wider audience can see it. The most compelling element in this ""Greenlight"" is that it puts our novice filmmakers in the studio system where we watch them deal with all the concessions they must make to please the studio executives.It is healthy to be suspect of any ""reality"" show, but once you get past the set-up (clearly set in place here to give them an uphill battle and stir up some drama), ""Greenlight"" feels like the real deal. Serious, classy and seemingly authentic. It floored me how much access we are given to the inner workings of Dimension and Miramax (on the verge of a divorce with it's parent company Disney, which by the way should give the anti-Disney fanatics out there something less to complain about). Bob Weinstein doesn't make an appearance but we hear a lot about him and the office politics of the studio - much of it not exactly flattering. That Miramax was actually allowing themselves and their movies to be opened up and shown like this is refreshing. It requires a real trust in the intelligence of their audience you never see on TV.Example. The boldest and most memorable moment comes when first-time director John Gulager, completely disillusioned at that point, pronounces that the entire movie is just a paycheck to him until he can make something he really wants too. The show then leaves us on that note until the next episode. Now that is a high-wire risk. Coming from a studio that ultimately wants people to still see this movie, to allow us to think ""Feast"" is garbage, that its director doesn't even believe in, for a full week is gutsy beyond words.While screenwriter Marcus, basking in their Hollywood experience, is endlessly fun to watch, the star of this season is Gulager. The season revolves around his arc beginning as a stammering oddball who just wants people to quite asking questions and let him ""make his movie"" and ends with him becoming a strong, confident, apparently talented director. It is a roller-coaster, but ""Greenlight"" has us firmly at every emotional bank. We cringe at Gulager's inability to communicate and laugh at a rabid pursuit to get his family (including his ""girlfriend of 20 years"") cast in the lead roles. We feel for his desire to pull off this life-long dream, prove he isn't just a contest winner. But we also see the side of producers Michael Leahy and Joel Soisson (both of whom become great informal narrators) who fear John may ruin the picture. We feel the stress baring down on them and the release when things go well.""Project Greenlight"" is a pure product of the medium. Only a TV show can, and would, rip the curtain back from in front of our escapist entertainment like this. Like ""American Idol"", ""Making the Band"" and ""Movie Magic"", ""Greenlight"" is a reality show that is forged out of an undisputed specialty for television - clearing out the smoke and letting us behind the scenes of industries built on fantasy, imagination and a little bit of complacent denial on all of our parts to believe in ""the magic of film-making"". People accept that movies and music just happen and demand it be good. Ben, Matt and Moore's goal with ""Greenlight"" is also, no doubt, to give the audience an idea of how mammothly complex it is to get a movie together and how slapped together it often is. The show is vastly informative to a point and careful to keep most of the actual film hidden so our entire suspension of disbelief doesn't collapse. Where would be the fun in that? We get morsels here and there to bait or interest.Who knows how ""Feast"" will ultimately come out, but ""Project Greenlight 3"" is addictive. Not only is it a voyeuristic wet-dream for movie fans, but it retains focus on the human elements and doesn't get bogged down in mechanics. Season 3 ultimately becomes a rewarding cheer-the-underdogs TV ride featuring a director nobody believes in, a script few understood, a genre critics look down on and a collection of people with their own conflicts coming together to make something bigger than themselves (and entertain the public). It captures the drive and atmosphere that causes people to become filmmakers authentically, something that would be depicted smarmy and sarcastically on most scripted shows. The thought of a horror movie being made instead of their pretentious coming-of-age drama may make the art-house snobs out there curl up at the bottom of the bathtub and wait for death, but this season is a completely different experience than the show has had before. I can't ask for anything more in a reality series.* * * ½ / 4"
78,HBO,We Can Be Heroes,0425674,"You know, this actor is frighteningly talented. 'We Can Be Hero's' has the whole package- hysterically funny,horrifically embarrassing ( in the good way, mind you) and quite heartbreaking. Apart from Chris Lilley's stunning performance, I have huge admiration for his co- actors, all of whom are unbelievably true to character. It is so beautifully made. I truly feel that Chris Lilley is a talent, that in years to come, will astonish us all with even greater work. Anyone with this much intelligence and talent is destined for great things. You will find someone you know somewhere in his characters, what ever country you live in. Just watch this series, and be amazed."
79,HBO,Crashbox,0321777,"I have seen this show Crashbox and it is a great show to learn. Michal Mcshane did a great voice for the Revolting Slob. Eddie Miclurg did a great polite female in the game of the Revolting Slob. This game is to learn new words. Crashbox is a funny, interactive series that challenges grade-school kids with hip, fast-paced games about history, math, spelling, grammar, culture and vocabulary. Each edition is comprised of seven to eight educational games (two to five minutes each) drawn from a bank of 14 game types, from ""Haunted House Party"" to ""Captain Bones"" to ""Dirty Pictures"" to ""Radio Scramble."" With up to ten or more different versions of a single game available, Crashbox is a truly modular series in which different versions of different games can be rotated from edition to edition. You will like that show it to learn"
80,HBO,Capadocia,1068899,"If you've seen or heard of the ""telenovela"" programs that appear on cable channels Telemundo or Univision, you probably know the name Argos, the producer of many of these shows (I'd have to say ""Gitanas"" remains my favorite). If the term ""telenovela"" signifies to you a kind of alternate universe where most of the characters are well to do, easy on the eye and spend most of their time talking and drinking--i.e., escapism--don't be put off from having a look at ""Capadocia."" Produced by Argos for HBO, it retains their trademark ""production values"" but also features grittiness galore. Like HBO's ""Oz,"" it's visually seductive but may well rattle your sensibilities. If you're an Anglo who hates reading subtitles, though, you should probably pass on it.It starts with a look at a seemingly tailor-made-for-telenovela Mexican family, with beautiful intelligent wife (Ana de la Reguera from ""Gitanas""), handsome but not so intelligent husband and unbearably cute little kids. She's a qualified pharmacist (which enters into the plot around episode seven, the latest I've seen) but chose to be a full-time capital-M mom---can't you just feel your cardiac cockles heating up? But when she catches hubby at home doing the nasty with her best friend (in one of the show's sardonic little touches, it's her kid clamoring for a missing toy that sends her back home unexpectedly), a fracas ensues with her friend promptly falling fatally down the stairs. (Does anyone ever fall down the stairs and not die?) In short order she's in the hoosegow which is de facto run by a psycho inmate called ""Bambi"" who has colluded with some crooked politicians and guards to start a blood soaked riot, thus prompting a public outcry for a ""new kind of prison"" where inmates will work (and be economically exploited by the politicians). (There's a ""lot going on"" in this show, numerous subplots.) A human-rights crusader (Dolores Heredia, also from ""Gitanas"") runs the new facility (or thinks she does) and like the Terry Kinney character in ""Oz,"" finds that there's a lot more to prison reform than just good intentions.No TV show will work without characters who make you want to keep seeing what happens to them. ""Capadocia"" has plenty of these. The female inmates look not just like ""real women"" but women who have been kicked around a lot by life (often literally). There's no maudlin attempt to depict them as capital-V victims of circumstance; we're invited to draw our own conclusions. (In one scene a nun jailed for selling drugs to help feed sick kids piously intones that a fellow inmate is ""doomed,"" which seems like the writers' sly dig at moral fastidiousness.) I'm very happy with the realistic depiction of women's needs for emotional connections, especially in this kind of situation. I'm not as happy with the depiction of almost all the male characters as jerks, but I guess I can't argue that ""guys aren't like that."" There are flashbacks and scenes of what I'm tempted to call (since it's Hispanic) ""magical realism"" with characters confronting specters from their past along the lines of ""Solaris."" (In one episode an inmate who's been forced to give up her new baby envisions him as a thuggish adult. This episode culminates in one of the most warpedly spectacular set-pieces I've seen on TV. Gives new meaning to ""dropping in on"" a concert.) It all fits together due to the care taken to concoct the overall hauntingly elegiac atmosphere. Mexicans excel at depicting both sadness and inevitability; since this is no telenovela, one suspects that (to borrow a line from ""Seven"") ""...this ain't gonna have a happy ending..."" or even a ""real"" ending at all, again as per ""Oz.""Of courseI have a few quibbles: the subtitles can be hard to read; characters pop in and out such that it's sometimes had to follow ""without a scorecard."" Since the penal system is depicted as SO thoroughly brutal and corrupt, one wonders how ""Bambi"" gets her way by threatening to expose the collusion of the politicians or by invoking her ""friends outside""; why can't they find a way to ""shut her up for good,"" cover it up & use the myriads of cops/bodyguards we see to protect them from street hoodlums? The character of the ""Colombiana"" (apparently the actress is actually from Colombia), a former beauty queen coveted by males and females although I personally don't find her ""all that,"" seems borrowed from a telenovela. She escapes from prison and from the kingpin character who's having his way with her, then wanders around town buying jewelry with his stolen money, blunders into a trap and finally implores the kingpin to take her back---yeah, okay, whatever...By the way, ""even in the Third World"" would a male inmate who's had a sex-change operation be put in a cell (or cell block) with knuckle-dragging macho goons? There's no ""protective custody"" capacity down there, even after the Heredia character intervenes for him? But bottom line, don't miss this pearl from south of the border---unsavory elements forming into a gem; available On Demand until 12/15/2008 for your convenience.Re the name Capadocia: in the second episode there's a reference to ""the city where the Amazon women lived,"" but since the episode titles have religious connections (""Genesis,"" ""Exodus"" etc.), it also seems likely that name was picked because the ""Cappadocians"" (a region of what is now Turkey) in the Bible were among the people who heard the Gospel in their own language after the resurrection of Jesus. Or maybe the writers just thought it rolled ""trippingly on the tongue,"" as Shakespeare put it..."
81,HBO,The Chris Rock Show,0118285,"This is the best late-night show since Arsenio. I believe he had him as a guest one time or another. But anyway there's no other talk show that tell it like he sees it like Chris Rock. That's what I love about the brother he's real. He doesn't sugar coat anything, if he thinks your movie stinks he tell you. If a woman is invited on his show and appears sexy to him he will not bite his tongue. It may seem offensive but he does it in such a way that it's hilarious. Keep rockin' them Chris."
82,HBO,Sr. Avila,2280066,"Not much of a Spanish TV watcher, especially not soaps, but stumbled on this while checking out OnDemand on HBO one night and now I'm completely addicted. It's like watching the Latin Sopranos, or better a combination of Sopranos and the Professional in Spanish. It's action packed and the scenes related to the family are well done. There are a few recognizable actors but all new for me. Love the slightly foreign feel, since I read it's filmed in Mexico, but not so much you don't believe it's real. The violence is brutal but not entirely gory and the connections between characters keeps you hooked. I'm 41 years old and I've always found Latin TV to be silly, not real enough but they figured this one out nicely. Highly Recommended!"
83,HBO,El Jardin de Bronce (The Bronze Garden),7048386,The story is amazing. The way it was filmed and how it shows the stunning city of Buenos Aires is beautiful. It's a very well done story. It unfortunately shows how corrupted the police can be too. Once you start watching it you can't stop. I would recommend everyone to watch it. It's very worth it.
84,HBO,The Neistat Brothers,1666727,"I discovered the Neistat Brothers on HBO on demand and after the first episode I was hooked. Now my wife is hooked as well. A very honest, engrossing, and very creative look at two people's lives. What this reminds me of is social network stalking on Face Book, but instead of it being your lame friend who is a computer programmer it is two very interesting and funny lives with a lot of talent. And while I don't always agree with all of their perspectives I do find myself as a 28 yr old male agreeing and relating to majority of their commentary on life. While this show doesn't make me want to quit my job and start making movies it does inspire me to have more fun and examine the fascinating surroundings and relationships in my life."
85,HBO,VICE News Tonight,6329790,"Maher's VICE 'News"" followed the war mongering MSM, supporting a convicted felon, Elliott Abrams as US envoy to Venezuela. Cherry picking shills to scorn Maduro, as the majority of Venezuelans support him. Not a scene scene from huge rallies that want the USA out of their government."
86,HBO,HBO First Look,0318220,"This is very good inside feature of up coming films of the year. It shows many behind the scenes and interviews by the actors, actresses, directors, and crew that makes it possible for excellent films. I remember back 1996 when several great movies that I thought were really good and they are some of My favorites came out in that vary year. Anyway they were Twister, Chain Recation, Ghost and the Darkness, The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Glimmer Man, The Phantom, and among others. I think this is cool program especially for the people who are biting at the bit for the up coming blockbusters and want to see some possible clips of the films and more. I believe this program is still on HBO currently so if you want to check for all of the great ones in the year of 2005 including Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Batman Begins, War of the Worlds, The Fantastic Four, The Island, The Cave, A Sound of Thunder, The Land of the Dead, Stealth, Doom, King Kong, and more then check it out today! I recommend it!"
87,HBO,Magnifica '70,4725820,"Set in 1970s Brazil, where an oppressive regime rigorously censors films they consider morally or politically suspect, Vicente works in the censor's office in São Paulo. Unlike most of the other people there he genuinely appreciates the art of cinema so one day, after having to ban a suspect film which features Dora Dumar, an actress he rather fancies, he tries to think of a way to make it acceptable. He then approaches the makers, the eponymous Magnifica Studio, without telling them who he really is and gives them an ending that adds a moral which means he can pass the film. This isn't the end of his involvement though; he is pressured to direct the studio's next film. He comes up with a story that is inspired by his own life. He must now live a double life as he makes the film without them finding out he is a censor or the censor's office discovering his involvement in the film. To make matters more complicated Dora isn't quite who she claims to be, Vicente's wife gets fed up of him always being away and has a string of affairs and his father in law, a powerful general, has a dark secret that he will do anything to hide.This was an enjoyable series that has plenty of drama as well, a few laughs and some tense moments when protagonists are in danger. The story gets a bit melodramatic at times but that is a good part of what made it enjoyable; this is especially true near the end when Vincente and the workers at Magnifica Studio must use their skills in film making to get them out of a very dangerous situation. The cast does a fine job; most notably Marcos Winter, who plays Vincent, a character who develops significantly throughout the series; Simone Spoladore, who plays Dora and Adriano Garib, who plays her husband, Manolo, the man who runs the studio. Given the nature of the films made at Magnifica there is surprisingly little in the way of 'embarrassing material'; just the occasional short topless scene or a bare backside. There are some disturbing scenes; most notably when characters are tortured with electricity and secondary characters are killed. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of subtitled drama of course if you understand Portuguese you can enjoy it without the subtitles.These comments are based on watching the first season; I hope the second season is shown here too one day."
88,HBO,Alice (2009),1447826,"I can't understand why this show was canceled. I watched it every Sunday on Latin HBO. The production values were pretty good, maybe not for American t.v. standards but still pretty good. Good direction, nice art direction, pretty damn good music, and best of all, good acting.Andreia Horta was a charming lead actress. She's fresh, extremely hot (all about her big firm butt ;) ), demonstrates she can express many feelings with her facial expressions. The episodes were a mix of crude situations, but felt very real. It wasn't all about Alice, the main character. The supporting characters added something to the plot in every episode. It displays the reality of many young people, specifically, those who are 25. It deals with sexuality, job opportunities, becoming mature, and more unexpected situations when you are young.It's a shame it didn't last for more time. The show had the quality to become a success.Still, I watch some re-runs."
89,HBO,Psi,3637900,"Psi is a Brazilian show that is dubbed in Spanish with English subtitles just to set the record straight.
It follows the story of a Psychologist in Sao Paolo, Brazil. It is fascinating watching the Doctor Carlo who is kind and empathetic but also a little reckless. The characters are complex and story frequently is unpredictable which makes the show so compelling. Superb acting by Emilio de Mello. I was surprised by how fascinated I was with this show. It is thought provoking. A realistic look at the often bizarre world of psychology and psychiatry.
Highly recommend."
90,HBO,Neverending Story,0115406,"I find myself agreeing and yet disagreeing with the other user reviews here. When I first saw the cartoon series, I had very mixed feelings about it. I was VERY impressed at how much energy the creators put into making everything feel as much like the first film as much as possible (voices for Falkor, Childlike Empress, Engywook, and Urgle all seemed especially right) as well as the design of the Ivory Tower and Falkor, and even down to simple things like the clothes that Bastian wears. The scriptwriters also were extremely good at writing the dialog to SOUND like the way things were said in the first film . . . however, they were catering to a specifically younger demographic, so the plots were, for the most part, horrifically juvinile.That being said, I find that there are a few episodes that I very much enjoy. My favorite is, perhaps, ""Perilin"" because Grograman was my favorite character from the novel that has never shown up in any film. And the voice actor PERFECTLY captured how I would have expected him to sound. The Desert of Colors was disappointingly not so colorful, but all in all, I find myself watching that episode occasionally.So if nothing else, make sure you see the episode ""Perilin"" for the closest adaption from the book."
91,HBO,Epitafios,0423646,"I stumbled on Epitafios while browsing through my On Demand service, looking for an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Am I glad I took a chance with this intricate, twisty series. Sometimes it goes a bit too far--our serial killer has escaped one too many times to be entirely believable--but I love the characters and their interactions and the fact that no one is safe. The show shouldn't be buried on HBO-Latino. This is a show that deserves to run alongside Rome and Deadwood and other higher-profile, regular HBO series. If you haven't watched this and think that a Spanish-language series with subtitles isn't your thing, just give the first episode or two a try. I bet you'll be hooked."
92,HBO,Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel,0290369,"""Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel"" is by far the best sports reporting show in the business it's more than X's and O's and winning and losing, it shows the sports world's real and emotional side with true and tragic stories. This program also helps you get to know the side of sports figures the way you never thought you would thru interviews. The interviews are conducted by the best reporters in the business like Bernard Goldberg, Frank Deford, Jim Lampley and many others and all are no holds barred and fair and balanced. The host himself Bryant Gumbel does a fine job, he's such a veteran of the sports world and also has been around the news stories so long that touch our spirits, and he's worked for many different networks, in my opinion he's a real reporting legend. Some of the stories over the years that are memorable are the rise of Pete Carroll's coaching life at USC after failing in the NFL, reports on sports gambling and video games, even cock fighting. The two most tragic are first the report on how tough many ex-NFL players have it after they retire, many dealing with so many injuries that they can't even get out of bed on a daily basis. The second most tragic to me is how legendary QB Terry Bradshaw found out he was suffering from years of life altering depression and bad panic attacks, showing even the well known battle mental disorders. Some of the most memorable interviews over the years have included John Madden, Bill Parcells, Jimmy Johnson, Paul Tagliabue and even the head of many networks and leagues, and thru the interviews you find out about the history and background of each and the tough questions are also answered. The tough issues are also covered like crime, sex, and drugs and when these vices occur in the sports world then ""Real Sports"" isn't afraid to report them. This program is award winning, trust me once you watched it you will agree ""Real Sports"" shows that more important things happen than just on the playing field."
94,HBO,Dane Cook's Tourgasm,0785062,"To anyone who is a fan of Dane Cook, beware of this show. If you expect to be laughing your a$$ off, well then go to comedy central and maybe you can catch his stand-up. This isn't a comedy at all but more like a drama. This show mostly consists of the bus ride to every venue instead of the act themselves. This is an early critique of the show, so they may show more stand-up once you get further into the season. Also, there is this one comedian name Jay Davis. He is probably the biggest wuss of a comedian that has ever lived. He gets heckled on the show then he goes to hide and cry in his bed. I mean come on, how did this guy get to be a comedian in the first place. There is more drama between him and this other comedian named Robert Kelly than there is comedy. So stay away from this show. This isn't a comedy at all, but just more of the same reality crap that has flooded TV."
95,HBO,The Alzheimer's Project,1432143,"Many people have a basic understanding of dementia, which is equated by most as the same as Alzheimer's Disease. However, there are multiple causes of dementia, with Alzheimer's only being the most common. This multipart series does an excellent job of humanizing the condition. There is a tendency to only think of those with very early memory problems or others who are bedbound with end-stage dementia. The Alzheimer's Project wonderfully illustrates the whole spectrum of the dementia process. Having a personal special interest in dementia care, I found this series to be the best single resource for non-clinicians to learn about Alzheimer's Disease."
98,HBO,The Shop,8755712,"I certainly hope that the bad reviews will not stop HBO from airing more episodes. My husband and I watched it in Canada. Might I add we are as white as white can be and loved the show. We liked the insight into what it is like to be black in America. How growing up poor and black and then becoming a superstar athlete made them question why people in their college liked them. How Snoop Dogg said that living as a black in America you don't realize that in other countries they don't treat people of colour the same way. Things you don't realize until you travel. Also, I love Jon Stewart and always will. I liked how it was a group of men discussing feelings, so rarely seen in person and something I think young men growing up should be exposed to.Hoping for more episodes"
99,HBO,Band of Brothers,0185906,"I am an 80 year old combat veteran (88th Inf. Div. Italy).I watched BOB on the History Channel. I was so overwhelmed, indeed a bit panicked by the authentic nature of 90+% of the uniforms, signs, noises (I take exception to the sound of incoming artillery).I cried several times at the authentic staging - for them and me.I cannot believe I'll watch it again. It's too much. Too real.We never had so much water allowed in a shower.Rate: 10/10"
101,HBO,When the Levees Broke,0783612,"By far and away the best documentary on Katrina and what happened to the people of my home, New Orleans. It captures the anger, the despair, the fear, and the humanity of our country's greatest disaster. I still cry when I see my city under water. I cry even more knowing others did not receive equal assistance because of the color of their skin. I was concerned that Spike Lee would put his spin on this tragedy, but he has done the opposite. He allows citizens from all over the city, economic and racial backgrounds to tell the real story. He gives a fair and balanced perspective on how all levels of our government failed the people of New Olreans and a good portion of the Gulf Region. I only hope that Mr. Lee comes back in a few years to film another documentary, ""The City New Orleanians Re-Built"".Thank you Spike and all the people at 40 Acres and a Mule for doing what had to be done - recording the real story. I see heaps of Emmys."
102,HBO,Generation Kill,0995832,"What you get to see here is a one-of-a-kind mini-series: this is as close to a documentary as it gets. The realities of modern warfare are shown honestly with no political agenda and you are left to draw your own conclusions. When I watched this series I remembered a quote from another film, 'The Siege' from 1998, where Bruce Willis' character, a high ranking army official, says something along the lines of: ""The army is a broad sword - not a scalpel. So trust me, you do not want to call the army, unless you have absolutely no other option"". From an artistic point of view what stands out the most is the ensemble of actors. Not once during the entire seven episodes did I not believe I was watching the actual characters - the performances and the direction in this production are flawless. I've never seen a series that felt as real as this. This goes beyond mere entertainment - this is simply the best contemporary television has to offer. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
103,HBO,The Pacific,0374463,"I'm guessing most of us watched 'The Pacific' for at least one of the following 3 reasons:1. We have an interest in history, particularly in WW2.2. We are fans of movies and television shows (well, the good ones anyway)3. We had seen - and loved - the previous Hanks/Spielberg co-production 'Band Of Brothers' and expected a mini-series on the same level.Now from reading some of the reviews here I gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers - and it's also why 'The Pacific' apparently left quite a few people disappointed. As for me, I wasn't disappointed - I was devastated.I'm a lucky man; I've never had to suffer through a war. But I had relatives who did, and though they're all long gone now, I'll never forget their stories. War is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure, but there are many different aspects and layers to it, because a war is not a single experience: it's all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it, and no single film or TV show can cover all of them. 'Band Of Brothers' focused on certain aspects of a war, and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was: the brotherhood of war. It was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst, most horrific circumstances.That inherently human element in 'BoB' was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists, and why we were - and still are - so deeply touched by what they had to go through. It's an outstandingly well made series, and I can't imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better. Which is why 'The Pacific' doesn't even try. Instead, it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war: the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it. Of course, just like 'BoB' it's also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers, but if there is a core theme in 'The Pacific' it's that of trauma: the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered; the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing you'll never be whole again.What we see in 'The Pacific' is Hell, plain and simple. It's scores and scores of anonymous, young Japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire, wave after wave, until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun; it's American soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them; it's vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive - which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn; it's kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal: guns, knives, flame-throwers or with their bare hands; it's people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life. And the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreaking.Over large stretches, 'The Pacific' is devastating and depressing to watch, and though I found it never less than compelling, it's actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in 'BoB' were left disappointed. But this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences, and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in Easy Company from 'BoB', you'll find that, while different, in terms of sheer quality 'The Pacific' is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessor.The realism, the performances, the music and the production values in the series are superb (this was a 200 million production after all), and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering. As for me, witnessing what these men went through left me devastated; yet I am grateful I've watched 'The Pacifc': because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldn't have to do the same. I originally rated this series 9 stars out of 10, but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the Pacific theater, it's clear that this is a 10/10. Outstanding.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
104,HBO,John Adams,0472027,"The first two episodes of this mini series have captivated me like very few things have. It is interesting to see a detailed look at the foundation of this great nation come to life instead of merely being read on page.The cast is stellar. Giamatti is a great actor and he brings John Adams to life. Wilkinson as Benjamin Franklin is one of the highlights. The realism of the time frame is brought to life like few movies have done; accuracy in costumes, to architecture, and locational shots.This is a truly moving piece, and a must watch for fans of history, and those with a appreciation of great cinema regardless."
106,HBO,Mildred Pierce,1492030,"To really appreciate this masterpiece of television cinema, the first step is to outgrow the original starring Ms. Crawford.Initially as I started watching the HBO version I tried to compare the scenes with the original, as I have seen it several times over the years.It's easy to compare the HBO's Wally to the truly wonderful Jack Carson, and just for comparison sake, Carson takes the cake. No challenge.How about Ms. Crawford's Pierce vs Winslet's? Crawford of course would win for her screen presence, and the magnitude of her personality. She would also grab the public's vote because she plays a heroine. Ms. Winslet's Mildred has a persona of a victim and comes across as too ordinary, compare with the superhuman presence of Crawford. So, I understand why a lot of us would automatically defer to the original and try to ignore the new.And what about Veda, how would I compare Evan Rachael's to Ann Blyth's wonderful 1940's performance. In many ways I'd nod the hat to Ms. Blyth, because the movie itself is so immersing.Judging solely based on the performances of the original characters of the 1940's version, the luscious black and white cinematography, and Ms. Crawford, it would be easy to dismiss the 2011 version.However if you look at the 2011 version as a standalone piece of grownup film making and the viewer is indeed a grownup who appreciates subtleties, this is one of the best modern movies ever made for television.Many complain about its pace, they whine that this new version doesn't have a bang of an ending, they complain that Winslet is not a heroine, and how is it possible for Veda to become so great as a singer in such a short time. However, the core reason for people's dissatisfaction with the HBO version is because the original was so good, and to be honest so manipulative. The original twisted the novel to maintain and in many ways revive Crawford's superstar status.The HBO version is an ode to masterful, grownup film making. I am simply blown away that we can still make such amazingly powerful cinema in the US.A huge thanks for those involved in this truly inspiring movie. Thanks for not cheapening it with juvenile gun fires and cheap dialog. Thanks for not catering to the lowest common denominator.This is a heck of a grown up movie, if you can just see it for what it is and not as a remake."
109,HBO,Five Days,0840094,"It is the middle of the day when Leanne Wellings stops to buy flowers by the roadside on her way to see her grandfather with her children. The children are in the car when Leanne goes missing. The kids abandon the car and search for her and it is many hours before grandfather Victor calls the police. Later that night Leanne's husband Matt and his stepdaughter Tanya raise the alarm properly and a missing persons investigation is launched headed up by DSI Barclay as the family implodes with hope and worry.Following on from the success of previous BBC/HBO crossover The State Within, this next joint effort was really pushed by the BBC, which maybe helped it get ratings but perhaps didn't help it when you look at the approach it takes across all five hours. The story is engaging but you do need to understand that it is not a cop thriller but rather a character story that is as much based on the mystery as it is on the emotional and personal impact on all those involved. I say this because I know many viewers were disappointed with this approach and I think it may have been because they assumed that the hype meant it would blow everyone away. And of course it didn't but what it did do was effortlessly draw me into the people and have me caring about everyone involved.Thus this is one of those dramas where it is not all about the resolution as it is about the overall drama. This is a good thing because the characters are all pretty well written throughout the five selected days and they are convincingly developed or broken as we meet them each time. This worked really well for me and the cast respond well to it. Some have seemingly stock characters with things going on outside this story while others are right in the middle of the pain and loss. Oyelowo turns in yet another strong performance as the husband and his emotional range in the character is impressive, but he is far from being the whole show. Wilton and Malahide both work well together as the parents. I didn't totally think Smart made her character work and, as much as I like Amuka-Bird as an actress, I'm not sure it helped anyone to have her walking round constantly with an air of surrogate grief. Bonneville is solid while Bonnard, McTeer and others are strong. The child performances are mostly good although Dryzek is the strongest of the three and stands up very well alongside the adult cast. Woodward is good but not given as much to do as I would have hoped.The downside of this approach though is that the actual story of the crime and the investigation is not as good as it perhaps should have been. Too often things rely on coincidence to move the case forward and I didn't like the way that many things happened while the characters are all within spitting distance of it  I appreciate the town is supposed to be small but not that small! The conclusion to the disappearances may also bug some viewers because it is in keeping with the way that it unfolded and, in my opinion, not that satisfying or convincing.Overall then a very good character drama that is sadly not quite as good as an investigation. The cast all rise to the material and are roundly good with the script. I'm glad I watched it because I did enjoy it but it is not as perfect as some of the gushing reviews around would suggest."
114,HBO,HBO Comedy Half-Hour,0251512,"The HBO Comedy Half-Hour was put together very well.. They pulled some of the funniest people together and output something great. Dave Chappelle, one of the funniest comedians in the business did not let me down, Lara Kightlinger with her cynical style of comedy was also very funny.. (Although I swear I heard her use some of those lines in a comedy central special). Although I had never seen Patton Oswald before, That guy had me rolling on the ground his entire sketch. The rest of the comics were also very funny. In conclusion, They were good... so watch them..... right now.."
115,HBO,Kindergarten,0787383,"Kindergarten is a 13-part children's documentary series which chronicles a year in the life of a real-life Kindergarten located in Upper Nyack (near Long Island) New York. Each episode which has a title and theme, is filmed unrehearsed and marks a milestone for the class of Jennifer Vaz Johnson, every elementary school child's dream teacher. There is, of course, the first day, the trip to the firehouse, the missing ""Gingerbread"" man, the acquisition of a hamster, a special spooky Halloween and joyous Christmas episode. And let's not forget the class garden outside and the ""mystery"" visitor who nibbled up the class's lettuce. And these are just some of the episodes. The thing that makes this documentary work so well is the encumbered clarity and spontaneity of each child's response (often hilarious) to an event or interaction with another student. Sometimes children are caught ""red-handed"" doing an alleged misdeed: there was the little African American boy who kicked or hit another student and then denied it, the young boy who disrupted class by talking out of turn, or the precious little tyke who snatched a crayon away from another student who then started to cry and make a big stink over it-- (""It was only a crayon"", the girl responds in her defense.) Ms. Johnson has infinite patience for each child,never once raising her voice and showing the viewing audience how GREAT a teacher she is (and serving as a great example for new primary school teachers) There is a very special holiday episode where children learn to embrace other cultures and the true meaning of holiday season and how Christmas, Kwanza and Hannekuh are celebrated. This is unforgettable stuff and a truly one of a kind documentary. Interspersed are short animation sequences which serve to announce the show's theme or as narration.Unfortunately, right now it is only being shown on HBO Family at 7:30 weekend mornings which is a very inconvenient time for both parents and children who may want to sleep late. Hopefully, it will be released on DVD as it would be a great tool to ease the anxiety of preschool children who have not entered the public school system to show them how much fun it can be. Every parent with a preschool age child should run out and buy this documentary as soon as it becomes available (which it isn't right now). Kudos to production executive Bruce Shaw and producer Karen Goodman for making such an innovative documentary. Oddly, a sequel of sorts aired on HBO and was made (not by the same producers) called ""Planet Twelve"", chronicling a year in the life of sixth graders."
117,HBO,Chris Rock: Kill the Messenger,1213574,"Once again, Chris Rock doesn't disappoint. His hard-edged comedy hits the mark. This show has just enough truth, at least from a male point of view, to make it relevant and just enough raunch to make it fun.As for the editing style of interweaving elements from various shows, it tends detracts from the comedy. It's a gimmick  a gimmick the show doesn't need. When the switch from one show to the other takes place, sometimes in mid sentence, I find myself wondering what just happened instead of listening to Chris. Plus, it tends to ruin one of the basic illusions of stand-up comedy. When I watch a stand-up comic, I know that the material is scripted, but I still like to get into the show and maintain the illusion that it is improv. The editing style shows that various different shows were basically the same word for word. It destroys that illusion.I recommend the show for the material, but be forewarned about the editing style. It can be a bit unsettling."
118,HBO,Temple Grandin,1278469,"I could not disagree more with the first reviewer.I think this is the least clichéd portrait of an autistic individual that has yet appeared on TV or in film. Like anything, autism has positive and negative effects, as this film makes plain in its well-rounded examination of this real individual's life. Temple Grandin does not understand people, her manner may be considered strange, but her ability to conceptualize and focus enables her to be an innovator.Unlike many other films, including ""Adam"" (which starred Claire Danes' husband, Hugh Dancy), ""Temple Grandin"" does not seem to request pity or condescension from the viewer or apology from the autistic character. Despite a childhood filled with bullying and derision from others (subtly sketched in the movie), Temple is focused, confident, driven, and gutsy. Her autism requires no pity and no apology: she is ""different, not less"" (a line repeated in the movie). That's the reason she was able to succeed. Yes, she gave the valedictory speech at her college graduation, though she did not speak until she was four: there is nothing far-fetched about it. Lack of language does not mean mental retardation.The movie jumps around in time, but I did not find it hard to follow. The main thrust of the narrative is Ms. Grandin's interest in cattle and the story of the educational path that led to her innovations in the field of livestock management. Episodes from her earlier life are inserted in the narrative in ways that give insight into the character. Her interest in science and her ability to conceptualize were nurtured by a caring science teacher, wonderfully played in a subtle performance by the always capable David Straithairn. Julia Ormond is also strong as Temple's mother.Ultimately, the people in Temple's life accept her and celebrate her for who she is, and for her unique insight and abilities. I hope this film will help people realize that autism is not a disease and is not a tragedy."
120,HBO,You Don't Know Jack,1132623,"If you remember the 90's, Dr. Jack Kevorkian needs no introduction. His name was as much the subject of medical controversy as it was the punchline of countless jokes. His name was as notorious to some as O.J. Simpson or Richard Ramirez, yet also as admirable to others as Bill Clinton or Michael Jordan.In the hands of many other directors, Kevorkian's biopic could have been treated more like a farce based on the doctor's past eccentricities, such as showing up in court wearing a powdered wig. Of course, Kevorkian's unabashed behaviors in front of camera lenses are depicted in this film, but fortunately, the details of his assisted suicides are not ever given any sugar coated treatments.""You Don't Know Jack"" tells the story about Dr. Kevorkian we should already know. Taking place from approximately 1990-1999, the film takes us from Kevorkian's days of being an unemployed physician to the trial that brought an end to his morally questionable practice for good. The lighting throughout this film is dark and often times dreary, but never dull thanks foremost to an impressive performance by Al Pacino that may be his best since ""Scent of a Woman"".When watching this film, there was rarely a moment where I thought to myself, ""That's Al Pacino playing Dr. Kevorkian"". Pacino's signature eyes and husky voice are still ever present, but he disappears into his role so effectively that I found myself saying, ""That is Dr. Kevorkian"". Not only is that feat so hard to accomplish for an actor so iconic as Pacino, but it's also hard to play someone who most of the American public knew so well from being on TV all the time.While it's impressive for Pacino to play the Jack we do know, he plays the Jack many ""don't know"" with a wry wit that makes an appealing character, even if you don't agree with assisted suicide. A great scene involved Pacino delving a subtle verbal blow to protesters outside his apartment building. When he says that the God he believes in, namely Johann Sebastian Bach, isn't imaginary like the God the protesters believe in, you can't help but laugh. I'm Catholic, and I thought it was hilarious.However, this movie's strength comes in its nonjudgmental view on Kevorkian's practices. The movie never tells you how you should feel, but also clears up the notion that Kevorkian practiced his assisted suicides with reckless abandon. Many of the suicides in the movie focus on the patients themselves, and their absolute certainty that they want their suffering to end. Of course, leaving their loved ones is their hardest decision, something the film indeed recognizes. Is it still wrong? This movie doesn't tell, nor should it.What's interesting, though, is the focus on Pacino's eyes during the scene where he performs his first procedure. They move back and forth on the screen as the operation continues, and don't try to mask any emotion of any kind. It could mean that Kevorkian doesn't care about his patients, or that he cares enough about them to keep the procedure as precise as possible. The main point: You decide.The same is true for Kevorkian's unabashed character on camera. It's all here in this film, but director Barry Levinson resists the temptation for Pacino as Kevorkian to wink and nod at the camera. Considering Levinson directed excellent character-centric comedy/dramas like ""Good Morning Vietnam"" and ""Man of the Year"", the temptation must have been there. Fortunately, he used his knack for dramas like ""Rainman"" and ""Avalon"" instead, and the effect worked wonders.The supporting cast behind Pacino is excellent. Danny Huston is fantastic as Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's successful lawyer, and is equally as good interacting with Pacino as he is in the courtroom scenes. Brenda Vaccaro, Susan Sarandon, and John Goodman are great supporting members of this film as colleagues who believe in Kevorkian's mission, but also have the outside vantage point to know what he's inevitably destined for.Whether you agree with Kevorkian's practices or not, it is impossible not to be compelled by this movie. The story draws you in, the characters are well developed in all the right areas, and it doesn't take more than five minutes for Pacino to convince you he is Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Do you know Jack by the end of this film? I'm still not sure. But I know an excellent movie when I see one, and this deserves 10 stars. See it!"
127,HBO,Mandrake,0466351,"Rubem Fonseca is a genius of Brazilian literature. Author of books like ""Agosto"", he understands the soul of the carioca man. Mandrake is an underground lawyer expert in cases of blackmailing and extortion who acts mostly as a negotiator. But Marcos Palmeira's acting is weak, his speech is artificial and so is his facial expression. Mieli is fine as Wexler, the old Jewish lawyer, Mandrake's partner. Maria Luísa Mendonça is a great actress and plays her role very well. The episodes themselves are interesting and show a poorly known part of life in Rio de Janeiro. The underworld of prostitutes, transvestites, sex clubs and the upper world of luxury mansions and socialites merge into a plot of intrigue and lots of money.3 out of 5"
129,HBO,Angels in America,0318997,"It seems to me that to be able to experience the full depth of this production, you need to meet a few requirements. First, you need to know that this is a PLAY. Like in any play, texts are delivered that you will not easily hear in everyday life (nobody makes up 'Antebellum Insufficiently Developed Sexorgans' as an alternative interpretation of AIDS during a split second in mid-conversation). Shakespeare isn't realistic in that way, Oscar Wilde isn't, Ibsen isn't, and nor is Tony Kushner. All of them are however extremely realistic in that they highlight essential aspects of the human condition in ways no other medium can achieve. Second, you need an ability to look beyond the surface. Reading reviews of AinA I'm stunned at how simplistically literal some people take it (maybe that explains why you've got Bush for president over there?). This play isn't about gays, it isn't about AIDS, it isn't about Jews and it isn't about Mormons. Its theme is the necessity for people to change, the scariness of change, while most of us would prefer to just let things stay as they are. That's what Louis Ironson wants and makes him run away from his sick lover (consider that: the superficially leftist intellectual is in fact a thorough conservative, more so than the apparently conservative Joe Pitt). That's what the angels want: unchangeable status quo; all the human history making tempted their god to leave heaven, and they want him back. This is the crux of AinA's undeniable political agenda: it sets out to show how conservatism of necessity thwarts and corrupts human nature. Oh yes, that's a third requirement: you really shouldn't belong to that curious group of people who consider the bible a god-given record of factual happenings rather than a piece of ancient mythology: you are likely to be shocked. Kushner's fantasies on biblical themes are very original indeed, and fit into a long tradition of reinterpreting ancient mythology in contemporary contexts. The church could learn a thing or two from him.Personally, I was very deeply moved by the experience of watching this (as I was by the play nearly ten years ago). I'm sure that, unlike some people seem to think, you don't need to be like the gay men portrayed in AinA to be able to stand it, let alone like it (a ridiculous notion anyway: as a gay man I constantly watch movies about heterosexuals, and am often touched by them). I'm a Dutchman, I know New York only from a few brief visits, and though I'm gay my lifestyle has very little in common with that of the men in AinA; none of that prevented me from being deeply engrossed in this story. Its themes, as said, are universal (if you doubt that this play is essentially about YOU, the closing scene ought to convince you otherwise; if that scene makes you cringe, as I saw somebody complain, you've not really been watching). Its texts are wonderfully written, unafraid of pathos, farce and intellectualism alike, and fiercely direct in their expression. The acting of the whole cast is formidable. Pacino may be redoing previous roles (Devil's Advocate sprang to mind), but boy, does this Roy Cohn have clout, and in the end, how peculiarly difficult it is to really hate him Patrick Wilson is the perfect pretty boy with a dark secret, and knows how to bring his torment across. Marie-Louise Parker at times has you wondering if she's really been taking pills (and I mean that as a compliment). There simply can't be another Louis than Ben Shenkman (that role was seriously miscast in the Dutch theater production I saw in '95), and Justin Kirk plays his taxing role with utter conviction. Jeffrey Wright goes all out on his ex-drag-queen-with-an-attitude character, and yet succeeds to remain believable as a person. Streep and Thompson are no less great, but I really feel the laurels in the end belong with Parker, Shenkman, Kirk and Wilson. To top it all off, the imagery is beautiful and full of fantasy, without going overboard on bloodless digital effects (it is still a play, remember). The atmosphere is often subtly and hauntingly unreal. And Thomas Newman's score  well, like any truly good music, words cannot do it justice."
130,HBO,Parade's End,1956017,"I personally doubt that keywords such as 'love triangle' or 'suffragette' do any justice to this excellent rendition of Ford's novel. Christopher Tietjens' so very noble, honorable and occasionally heroic behaviour in every aspect of his intentions and actions, as well as the overall background of WWI petty intrigues, the so vivid rendition of the atrocious human suffering & desperation on the front line are the true show stealer. Excellent performances by all cast, in particular Benedict Cumberbatch (huge in his role !!!), Rebecca Hall and Adelaide Clemens... Oops ! This is the very 'love triangle' I was arguing against just a few seconds ago... One more actor who's absolutely perfect in his role is Roger Allam, as General Campion. Drawing the line: viewers of all ages and every level of education should find this series to match every bit of their expectations... Irrespective whether these rather look towards the 'love triangle'... or they go much deeper into psychoanalysis of intimate family, friendship, love relations or the noblesse of human behaviour under deeply stressful conditions. Today's human society is in serious need of individuals such as Christopher Tietjens... (not really the 'last' parade... I hope...). Highly recommended, absolutely nothing is obsolete or worthless in this movie rendition of British society during the WWI years !"
135,HBO,Witness,2475150,"There was a lot of conjecture and innuendo in the film, but very little to support it. Rio de Janeiro probably is a hell hole, and difficult to document. This HBO special did very little to penetrate that difficulty. Conspiracy fans will like it, but others will leave wondering about facts vs. fantasy. Interviews with anonymous taxi drivers. Voice over by persons who have an issue but no facts. Comments from the crowd, ""don't drag her body,"" when the film shows a standard body removal in a body bag. Police interviews that are subtly challenged when a later appointment by a colonel is not kept. Suggestions about raids that did not occur, as if there was something suspicious about schedule changes. Allegations about mass murder without any evidence. Assertions that bodies disappear when the burned body is very much in evidence on film. Yes, identification will be problematical, but it hardly was a disappeared body. Brasil deserves a more factual film and analysis."
142,HBO,The Pee-wee Herman Show on Broadway,1839648,"25 years ago, every single Saturday morning at my sorority house meant watching Pee-Wee's Playhouse without fail. We all loved it; we all had our favorite characters. Mine was always Chairry. When CBS cancelled the show, I was heartsick. The show meant so much to us! And I have missed everything about it.Seeing this Broadway comeback on HBO couldn't have been more thrilling for a Pee-Wee's playhouse fan like me. I only wish I were lucky enough to be in the audience. It was great seeing so many of the original characters. Sadly, we missed Phil Hartman. How great to see the original Miss Yvonne!The staging and production was AMAZING. The puppeteers and voice-over artists were outstanding. And what can I say about Pee-Wee except I am so, so happy to see him again. There were so many moments that made me laugh so hard, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Let's just say, Pee-Wee is EXACTLY the same. He never misses a beat. The songs are exceptional. If you loved Pee-Wee's playhouse in the 1984 movie or in the late 80s on TV there is no way you won't enjoy this. And keep in mind, this was a live show...and everything came out perfectly. I hope this is just the beginning of Pee-Wee's comeback. You are our real Peter Pan! Thank you so much for this show!Much love, your fan and friend, Susan in Chicago"
145,HBO,Brody Stevens: Enjoy It,2646374,"Let me give you 3 words to describe ""Brody Stevens: Enjoy it!"". Heartfelt, Life-changing, Laugh-a-minute-joyride. The show consists of 6 fifteen minute episodes that chronicle the trials and tribulations of comic Steven Brody Stevens. The first 2 episodes detail his slow spiral into madness and his triumphant return to glory all the while referencing his scene stealing roles in movies such as ""The Hangover"", ""The Hangover Part 2"", ""Due Date"", he was cut out of ""Funny People"" and various podcast appearances. If you like to chuckle and have a soft spot for humans, you'll love this show. Enjoy it!"

152,HBO,Tenacious D,0388462,I just picked up this dvd and haven't laughed as hard in a while.  Already showed it to three different friends on 2 occasions.  Kage and Jables rule. They know how to make some damn funny songs (infinitely funnier than Weird Al and Adam Sandler)  AND they have mad talent musically as well.  I wish they had more stuff out.  JB's pretty good on Mr. Show too.  If anybody out there likes the D they'd probably like Mr.Show too.  BUY THE DVDS
153,HBO,Jonah From Tonga,3431720,"One of my favorite series on HBO! The most accurate portrayal of a troubled teen that I have ever seen apart from real life. Jonah From Tonga has received many bad criticisms for Chris's use of so called ""Black Face"", the whole point of the show has been lost on political correctness. How could Chris expect anyone else to accurately play Jonah when he created the character in his mind and depends on the use of improve when he is in character? If you take the time to actually watch the show and see how Jonah develops over the series, then you would see a whole backdrop of cultural, and social elements forming to shape a young impressionable mind into a functional member of society, and your own racist ideas will fade. It takes a village and that is what I believe the whole concept behind this masterfully put together show proves. By the way if you are only into mind numbing cookie-cutter shows and can't step out of the politically correct conformist societal box, then go watch Friends re-runs."
154,HBO,The Weight of the Nation,2327631,"I watched this documentary series since I'm interested in the subject. But even though it does indeed contain some research about obesity, it's mostly an activist production. It begins every episode with ""we have to take action"", basically assuming that obesity is a problem that only the government and taxpayer money can solve. A personal responsibility aspect is sorely absent.The worst part of it all was at the end of episode four, when you had this Hispanic community where no one spoke English patting themselves on their backs for having managed to get their local government to pay for a park for their children to play in. That was a ""difference they made"". If they had raised the money themselves, I would have empathized, but how is it the least bit difficult to beg the government for money? They didn't have to do anything at all.So if you believe in personal responsibility, this series does leave you with a bad taste in your mouth."
155,HBO,Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways,3893538,"In a day and age where social networking and other new-age website mediums are pointing a middle finger to artists who struggled to get where they are, Sonic Highways restores the inspiration that is slowly being lost. Today, the music world is being hacked by those who believe views from those looking into a computer screen is the best gratifying experience. The world of musicians only playing music for their own ears is getting lost into history. Now, people are wanting cameras around every note being played, so they can become the next online star who obtains the spotlight for a short amount of time.Dave Grohl begins this incredible journey by taking us to the old blues and punk rock routes of Chicago. He establishes the fact that many of the musicians didn't expect to gain a bigger audience than the 50 people crammed inside of a local club, or those listening on the side of a street. This is what I personally enjoy; fellow musicians who can enjoy music, without ever expecting it to leave the room. The gratification of playing it for a small amount of people, or just for yourself is greater than millions of views.Though the caparison to the online digital age isn't addressed, the feeling when watching this series is, ""how I f**king miss those days."" Watching Sonic Highways is like dusting off an old record while sitting in a room listening and remembering. The series is an inspiration within itself."
157,HBO,Olive Kitteridge,3012698,"There will, I think, never be a film series that even approaches this film's excellence. It is one of the most uniquely cast and expertly played works of art I will probably ever experience. The performances were staggeringly riveting. Frances McDormand and the rest of her supporting cast were magnificent. I did not want it to end and I surely will not describe the minutiae of it for fear I would give away its essence.Brava to Frances McDormand acting in and producing a film made for her and Bravo to Richard Jenkins, with whom I fell in love. Three cheers to all the other actors who made this film great.This series brings the complexities of living to the screen. Life, as Olive says, confounds her and it does me as well. I'll bet most of us in our small worlds can say that too as life does not always live up to one's expectations of it and we are often trapped by those who came into our lives through no fault of our own. There were WONDERFUL performances all around. See it. It is a must."
161,HBO,Classical Baby,0466731,"The 3 disc DVD set was purchased for my 2-year old daughter for Christmas. We have since watched all three discs well over 20 times. While the 25-minute running time is a little short for our tastes, it's well worth it. A beautiful combination of classical music and famous artwork combined with child-friendly animations makes these shows captivating for both the young and old. Adults will love the soft music and the famous artwork, while the child marvels at the infant conductor and the cartoons ""playing"" in the pieces being portrayed. A wonderful option on the DVDs are ""Pop Ups"" that show you what the titles are of the pieces being played and the artwork being shown. A helpful tool for older children and adults that wish to further their own art education."
162,HBO,The Jinx: Robert Durst,4299972,"Just finished the entire series. This was such a good watch!! At first it didn't sound interesting enough, but after a few episodes of seeing bits and pieces while my husband watched, I was hooked.I won't give away any spoilers, but this show basically did the amount of investigative research that you'd hope police detectives would do (but apparently, in this case, didn't). Jarecki and his team did a wonderful job... I don't know how this could have been any better. Also love the scenes and music in the beginning credits (Fresh Blood, by Eels).The last two episodes are just breathtaking. I don't think anyone expected the outcome of this show when they first watched (or started filming)!This show definitely deserves some Emmys next year!!"
163,HBO,If God is Willing and Da Creek Don't Rise,1587373,When the Levees Broke is going to be viewed as one of the great documentaries so I was eager to watch this one. Unlike many people I have enjoyed Spike Lee's films over the years. I don't always agree with him but he is one of the few American directors today doing anything though provoking.His segments on BP were really the strongest and most compelling. He probably could have done a two or three part film: one documenting police corruption in NOLA which was legendary prior to Katrina and one about the BP disaster which taught us that when a mega corp screws up we really are impotent. I think he over stretched on Haiti. That could have also been another documentary. Spike Lee is a man with a point of view but he lets his subjects speak for themselves and weirdly enough I found Micheal Brown less the villain than I would have thought. Of course he was self justifying. Wouldn't we all in his position.Worth watching. Kudos to HBO for even slapping documentaries on during prime time.
165,HBO,Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,3838978,"I didn't like Sinatra as a kid of the sixties, he was my parents' star. I never appreciated his style of acting, it seemed too damn smug. I never understood the folks my age who would listen to Sinatra for hours. I always thought The Chairman was vaguely scary. All that said, this is just about the best damn documentary I have ever seen. Framed by songs from Frank's first ""retirement"" in 1971, it combines voice-overs by friends and family with fantastic film clips and pictures from the 60'a and 70's and beyond. For somebody who lived through this era, even if you never liked the guy this is a great walk down memory lane. And love, like or hate him, Frank led one driven, distinctive and fascinating life from beginning to end. Very highly recommended."
173,HBO,Show Me a Hero,2492296,"Just amazing. It's rather understated and procedural many of the times (but nothing unsurprising if one has seen David Simon's TV series). What it does in the six hours is amazing though. Its character development is exquisite, and by the time it's over it feels like it was a run of an actual television series. Of course, it could only be this long, but that doesn't stop me from wishing it WAS a longer series. Oscar Isaac is an amazing actor. I've said it before and I'll say it again, he's doing things not many actors right now are (or even can). The amount of raw talent he has, as well as the amount of warmth he can convey is staggering. That's what makes the end of the series so heartbreaking. I really hope this wins the Miniseries Emmy next year, and that Isaac also takes home the trophy."
175,Netflix,Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,4834206,"In this 'golden age of television', the higher quality shows are usually the darker, more thought provoking series (such as Breaking Bad, Mr Robot and Westworld). However, in the case of A Series Of Unfortunate Events, this deep, dark tone is tweaked to create a more light-hearted show that does not come at the expense of the quality. The series lies in between 'adult' and 'kids' TV genres, creating a strange, funny show for the whole family. Don't let the forgettable 2004 movie scare you off, because the series gets right what the movie got wrong. From what I have seen of the series so far, there is a colorful, but dark sense of humour, some great acting, and well crafted dialogue that make the series worthy of a watch. The longer TV episode format allows for a more complete story, with one book spanning two episodes (instead of the movie cramming in three books). It is a lot more nuanced than the movie for this reason, with extra scenes and dialogue filling in the backstory and adding depth to the characters. Yes the show is absurd; yes sometimes there are things that might make you question why you are watching it. It is definitely for a certain audience, but at the end of the day this series of unfortunate events is not so unfortunate after all."
176,Netflix,Santa Clarita Diet,5580540,"I saw this show advertised and thought it may be OK to fill a gap if there was nothing much else on to watch.The first episode was good, so I watched the second, then the third, and couldn't stop watching it as each episode got better and better as the characters developed.Each and every performance in this comedy is brilliant, from the most minor of supporting roles to the lead cast.I really didn't have high expectations, but this comedy is HILARIOUS"
177,Netflix,Marvel's Jessica Jones,2357547,"This review pains me to write, because I genuinely think that Season 1 was the pinnacle of serialized television. It had amazing plotting, a satisfying ending, a terrifying villain, characters that I loved, nothing superfluous, beautiful cinematography and tone. It delivered on every promise that it made. I could not wait for Season 2. And those two years were tough. Alas it finally arrived. I knew going in that it had a tough act to follow and so I made a concerted effort to judge it on it's own merits and not to dismiss it just for failing to achieve the impossible by living up to the first. What went wrong. Plotting: All over the place with little focus. A terrifying villain? Try NO villain. Characters that I love? Yes but the two leads are mostly kept separate from each other for some strange reason. Nothing superfluous? Carrie Ann Moss and her entire sub-plot was boring and irrelevant. Jessica's rival PI was a flat plot device. A satisfying ending? I wouldn't know, I couldn't get past episode 8. It was putting me to sleep. The season did continue to have beautiful cinematography and tone/atmosphere, but that gets no points from me if the writing is dull. Nutmeg can make good egg nog great, but it's not appetizing when eaten on it's own. I think the biggest problem with Season 2 is that it fails to deliver on Jessica Jones' core promise: it is a sci-fi super-hero show about a tortured loner who does not want to be a superhero but is, none-the-less, forced to fight super-villains because they are threatening her and the people she loves. In other words, Season 2 was Jurassic Park without Dinosaurs. I'm giving the show a 5. A perfect 10 for the first season, and a 0 for the second."
178,Netflix,Stranger Things,4574334,"Stranger Things is a 1980s inspired and themed science fiction horror Netflix show. The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET. The performances from all of the cast are great especially the child actors, who show the right amount of charisma and banter you expect from kids growing up in the 80's. However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series. The Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films. It's truly something special! 9/10"
179,Netflix,Altered Carbon,2261227,"I haven't read the novel upon which this show is based, so I can't comment on whether or not this is a faithful adaptation; I am, however, a huge fan of the sci-fi subgenre commonly known as ""cyberpunk"" (in case you're not familiar with the term, think of films/stories set in an urban, dystopian high-tech future like 'Blade Runner', 'Akira', 'Ghost In The Shell', 'Strange Days' or 'The Matrix' and you get the idea), and as such I can absolutely testify to the fact that 'Altered Carbon' is one impressive looking example of that particular brand of science fiction. What stands out right from the start is the worldbuilding. Many of the characters have complicated backstories that are crucial to the plot, and the rich history of their world is equally important, but what this series does remarkably well is show rather than tell. Instead of relying on lengthy monologues for exposition which have a tendency to weigh a story down and make the narrative lose momentum, we get the clues we need via flashbacks or just by seeing and learning about this world through the eyes of the protagonists. And what a world it is: the production values are insane, especially considering this is a TV show. There is so much eye candy for a sci-fi nerd like me; nearly every shot is packed with such an abundance of visual information that I had to hit pause several times to take it all in.But the world of 'Altered Carbon' isn't just ""decorated"" with visual effects and future tech to make it look cool (though it DOES look very cool); everything we see has a function and is there for a reason. It feels real and has that ""lived-in"" look that even big-budget Hollywood productions rarely get right. What I should probably also mention is that this is a hard R-rated show (if this were a feature film, it would actually perhaps be closer to a NC-17 than an R) which doesn't hold back in terms of sex and violence. Also, if you're not familiar with the genre or used to a more straight forward narrative where everything is explained to you, 'Altered Carbon' may initially feel a bit confusing or even overwhelming, because you're being thrown head first into a strange new world where you - like the protagonist - have to process an overload of information in order to get a sense of orientation. Stick with it though, and things will start to become clearer. As for the plot itself, I won't give anything away here; it's enough to know that it starts with the protagonist being brought back from ""retirement"" to solve a murder mystery. But unlike the grand daddy of all cyberpunk films, 'Blade Runner', this has less of a brooding, ""noir"" vibe to it; instead it's an action-heavy, at times pulpy but very densely plotted story with lots of colorful characters and so much going on that it doesn't drag for a second. To sum it all up: for sci-fi and cyberpunk fans this show is a must; for all other carbon-based life-forms, well, it may not be an ""altering"" experience, and it certainly isn't perfect, but if you don't give up after the first couple of episodes you could be in for a nice surprise. 8 stars out of 10 from me.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
180,Netflix,Orange Is the New Black,2372162,"Season 7 is going a tad bit overboard trying to hit all the political hot button issues.
I'm all for trying to get the message out but every storyline deals with an unfortunate issue and it's kinda depressing.
> You've got female genital mutilation, unlawful deportation, poor treatment by ice agents to immigrants being held, the ""me too"" movement both the cause and the effect and the validity on both sides of the story. The illegal immigrant mother getting her children taken away, etc.
> I still like the show but it has completely changed it doesn't seem like a work of fiction anymore. Its heavy and feels more like a platform for political awareness."
181,Netflix,Love,4061080,"I like this show because it's not quite a sitcom and it's not quite a drama. It feels very real, like something you've probably experienced in your life before. There are so many little moments that strike a chord with me... The awkward silence after cracking a terrible joke. The exalting victory of the person you like finally texting you back. The struggle of navigating parties where you don't know anyone.Some people might not like this show because of that rawness, but I for one find it endearing. I love seeing Mickey and Gus' story play out in such an unconventional way. You really do feel sympathy for the characters' successes and failures. Give it a try, because you might find a little bit of yourself in this show."
182,Netflix,Narcos,2707408,"Narcos is an intriguing and entertaining series. Netflix again done a very good job. Season 1 tells the true story of notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, who became a billionaire through the production and distribution of cocaine, while also focusing on Escobar's interactions with drug lords. This is a massive story.Escobar's life has attracted my attention too. I watched many videos and read books about Escobar's life. The show educates you on the Medellin Cartel and it is a very interesting topic to learn about. Pablo Escobar had much more influence on the political system than i would expected. This series has added a lot to me about it. Wagner Moura is an excellent actor and he learned Spanish just for the Pablo Escobar's role. He was born for this role. The bilingual dialogue adds a new layer of authenticity to the project and shows it's commitment with the original story. The long and often complicated story of Pablo Escobar is portrayed simple and effective for viewers not to get lost in what is going on.Congrats to Netflix for such a powerful, incredible production. I would recommend this show to all my friends and anyone looking for a great show to watch. This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while. Can't wait for the next season to come out! 10/10"
183,Netflix,Marvel's The Punisher,5675620,"After the first season, with the release of the second season, I finished the series in a breath. I think this is the best project of the Marvel-Netflix partnership. It is a solid series that has been achieved after the cancellation of many Marvel-Netflix joint projects.Action and blood enthusiasts will love this series. There's a lot more blood, death and action than the first season. In the second season has as much violence, blood, action and cruelty as you don't want. At this point, one of the other thanks must go to the kerography team. As you will certainly notice, we are watching episodes filled with fight and conflict scenes. The tempo is not interrupted for a moment, and each episode tries to place at least one action sequence. The Punisher's 2nd season just put Frank Castle in the chaos he deserves, and he succeeded in bringing all the minuses into a negligible situation.The season has two main villains and both are as wild as the Punisher. The fiction is also established accordingly, and our two main villains are advancing in parallel. Curtis is one of the good characters of the season. He represented the conscience side of the series very firmly. Amy is another prominent character of the season. She's under Frank's protection because she's close age to Frank's dead daughter. It's fun to see Amy with Frank. Amy is a well-designed character. Her adolescent behavior, her indiscretion, and Frank's reaction to all these things are very natural. With Jon Bernthal's great acting, we have access to the emotions of a father hidden behind a bloody face.The music uses were probably the best among the Marvel-Netflix co-productions. Too much music has been used and each one is very successful in passing the emotions of the scenario. Like Daredevil's corridor scenes, it's like we're going to look again at the Punisher's list of songs. And of course it is necessary to mention the last episode. It was one of the finest series finals for me. After many striking and emotional moments, it is impossible not to experience emotional explosion with the last scene. The Punisher role is seated on Jon Bernthal like a shirt.We have watched an immaculate season with strong scenes of conflict, good acting, immersive fiction and fluent scenario that never falls behind its first season and even better for some of us than the first season. I hope it will be a long-term series and we will continue to watch Frank Castle. 10/10"

185,Netflix,House of Cards,1856010,"After committing so much time to what was once a great show, I can only say avoid season six. It's ponderous, dull, full of plot lines that go no where and has one of the worst series finales ever made. They should have cancelled it when Spacey was sacked."
186,Netflix,Mindhunter,5290382,"For those of you who came here looking for something like 'Se7en', because you thought, well, it's from David Fincher and it's about serial killers, I have bad news: this is not that kind of show. But if you came here looking for something more like 'Zodiac', because you thought, well, it's Fincher producing a show about people investigating serial killers, you might indeed find something you like. And if you appreciate long-form storytelling focusing more on human drama than on action scenes, AND you're a bit of a science nerd on top of that (and by that I'm also implying you don't mind watching a show where people are talking most of the time), then, my friend, you are in for a treat.The reason I absolutely love 'Mindhunter' is this: I'm the kind of person who always wants to know why we know what we know. Because we DIDN'T always know. Somebody had to make a start; someone had to make that first step, that first discovery and draw that first conclusion. Somebody had to be curious, probably persistent, maybe even daring in their quest for knowledge. The history of science is littered with warriors, some of whom we now celebrate and hold in high esteem - but we have a tendency to forget that many scientists also were tragic figures who had to fight against restrictions imposed by society and risked paying a high price - professionally and personally - for their fight against ignorance. And it's those aspects of science that I find so fascinating, and it's precisely those aspects that 'Mindhunter' is interested in; not the ""showy"", glamorous stuff, but the meticulous groundwork and the personal human drama inherent in the quest for knowledge. And if you, like me, have a morbid curiosity for all the darker aspects of human nature, it surely doesn't hurt that the particular branch of science whose origins this show explores is that of criminal psychology: the science which tries to understand how the minds of criminals work and what causes them to commit their crimes.As you might have guessed, 'Mindhunter' isn't concerned with shoplifters or what goes on inside the head of someone who commits insurance fraud, but rather with criminals whose behavior is a tad more serious (like, you know, murderers who have a penchant for engaging in sexual activities with their victims' severed heads - stuff like that). And it isn't a documentary either; although the characters are based on real people and the show offers a realistic portrayal of serial killers, this is a dramatized account of events made for our entertainment. And entertaining it is, and on a high artistic level at that: the performances are fantastic; cinematography, editing and direction bear the clear trademark of the master filmmaker who produced and partly directed this (though it must be said that while Fincher appears to be the creative leader, the project was brought to him by one Charlize Theron who owns the rights to the book upon which the show is based and also serves as a producer, and the excellent teleplay was predominantly written by Jennifer Haley and the show's credited creator Joe Penhall).To sum it all up: 'Mindhunter' is a show that takes full advantage of its format; this is long form storytelling as it was meant to be, and while it probably doesn't work for people with short attention spans, the patient viewer is rewarded with a fascinating, richly layered and suspenseful drama exploring the origins of criminal psychology and criminal profiling. Excellent stuff: 8 stars out of 10.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
187,Netflix,Marcella,5269594,"I can honestly say I've never seen anything quite like Marcella. Unfortunately I don't mean that it in a good way. 
The first season was entertaining if a little frustrating due to having plot points hanging in the air, but I could accept that as it was obvious those plot points would be picked up in season two. 
It was (note - was) a fairly standard police drama - gritty setting, messed up detective etc. Sure it was a bit silly and far fetched in places but it remained fairly grounded.
Then came the second season, and wow I don't know what happened in the writer's room, but someone, somewhere lost the plot.
Character after character is introduced to the point where there were so many stories going on that it became hard to keep track of everything. But don't worry I said to myself, at some point all of these stories will come together into an epic finale. And yet no they didn't, many were left unresolved, characters that had big parts for multiple episodes (if not most of the season) suddenly disappeared without trace never to be mentioned again. Worse still, each of the stories got more and more far fetched and unbelievable to the point where aliens could land and you'd probably just accept it.
For a police drama there was very little actual police work being carried out, every break in the case came from coincidence - which occurred at an increasingly alarming rate.
Many of the plot points from season once were reintroduced early on but then never mentioned again leaving parts of the story still unexplained.
Worse still, the writer even said in an interview that it didn't matter about the disappearing characters or unexplained plot points as it was just like real life in which we don't know what happens to everyone we meet. Ermmm well no actually, that isn't how writing in any form works.
Finally, I'm not sure how to even talk about the final episode of season two as fter all the ridiculous twists and turns, it ramps things up to 11. 
I think the editor must have edited in footage from a completely different show as the final ten minutes are probably the worst and most hilariously bad change of plot line I've ever seen. I'd almost recommend watching both seasons purely to see what I mean. If ever a show has been made up as the writer went along then it's this one. 
Sadly despite the awful writing (which to repeat is the worst I've ever seen), I probably would watch season 3 if there is one, because I can't wait for the episodes when she either:A) wakes up and realised she's still a child and it was all just a nightmare after watching too many episodes of Paw Patrol.Or B) is saved by a Doc Brown who asks her to go back to the future to ride hover boards and save the world."
188,Netflix,Grace and Frankie,3609352,"I binged the series over a 2-day period and wished there was more. The characters were well developed and the whole thing was very entertaining. It covered many bases that divorce can bring about to family and friends, and dealt with issues of loss, honesty and aging, among others.I wish Sheen and Waterston had had greater chemistry between them, but their interactions with the family members were believable and poignant. I especially enjoyed June Diane Raphael and Baron Vaughn, as two of the four adult children.What I can't decide is who I liked better, Fonda or Tomlin. In each case, they braved characterizations that were vulnerable and multi-faceted. In the case of each, this is their best performance, and the two together were phenomenal. Funny one moment and heart-tugging the next. This is an adult story, in the best sense of the word."
189,Netflix,Arrested Development,0367279,"This show takes a few episodes before you *really* GET it.  And once you get it, you'll realize why everybody thinks it's one of the best sitcoms ever.Each character is really defined and original...with real, unique personalities.  All of the actors have fantastic chemistry, making for really great interactions and relationships within the show.The writing for this show is great, and the plots are so absurd that you can't help but find them funny.  A refreshing change in a world where people like reality shows...it's the only good sitcom left."
190,Netflix,Sense8,2431438,"Netflix does it again. After House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and Daredevil, they now release one of the best series ever. Well directed and written, gorgeously shot and edited From the opening sequence, you know you are watching something very special. Sense8 has the human element that Matrix lacked. It reminds me of The X-Files, but better. It is fantasy and science fiction, but not far-fetched. Not even for a single moment. It feels alive, real and very, very exciting and suspenseful.Andy and Lana Wachowski go around the world to bring you this beauty... From the streets of Nairobi to the alleys of San Francisco through the smoggy Mexico City and the snowy mountains of Iceland, this show brings it all and it is DEEP! The series brings elements of drama, suspense, comedy and action and differently from other Wackowski's movies; it brings characters we can relate. Every single one of them is incredibly well constructed and the cast performance is superb. It is impossible to watch this show without deeply connecting with those people. I cheered, I cried, I laughed, I bit all my nails and I feel in love with Kala, Riley, Lito, Nomi, Capheus, Wolfgang, Will and Sun. I adore those characters and at the end of the season, they were like my own family. This, my friends, is great cinema. Nothing else! and it deserves much more! I can't wait for season two."
191,Netflix,The Ranch,4998212,"Parts 1-5 of the Ranch are fantastic, they are light hearted fun and hysterical. Part 6 made the ranch go from a comedy to something like days of our lives. Its no longer funny, its just drama..... This show sucks now"
192,Netflix,Marvel's Iron Fist,3322310,"I hoped the second season would fix the show, but instead, they added bad writing to make the show even worse than before. Generally speaking, if you are looking for an action Sci Fi with a good story, then Iron Fist is not the answer."
193,Netflix,BoJack Horseman,3398228,"At a glance, this show looks like your run of the mill wacky, raunchy adult cartoon comedy. And yes, it has plenty of that with the titular character's rude and obscene behavior, and a saturated slew of animal puns. There are wacky characters and absurd plots to be sure, but all of that eventually takes a backseat to the fact that Bojack Horseman is, at heart, a nuanced and overtly depressing show about pain and self-loathing.This season really has more in common with Jody Hill's Eastbound and Down than it does any of the cartoons it's often being compared to, not just in the sense that it's a dark character study but also in the aspect that it's not episodic at all. Continuity plays a huge role in the show, and many of the episodes start exactly where the last one left off (evidence that the writers were catering to the ""binging"" crowd). A lot of the funniest jokes come from references to past episodes (such as the wonderful moment where Bojack assumes that on his last drinking binge he must have become obsessed with David Boreanaz for some reason.) As depressing and serious as the shows ultimate arc really is, the absurdist icing that comes from immersion in this world where anthropomorphic animals are taken for granted helps make this bitter pill an enjoyable meal. Great comedic performances from Amy Sedaris, Paul F. Tompkins, and Aaron Paul don't hurt either. But overall, Bojack Horseman is a thoughtful, witty feel-bad comedy in the best way."
194,Netflix,Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,3339966,"I'm a little late to the party as I've only watched Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt this year, but I figured it was time to watch it since I'm a fan of Tina Fey and 30 Rock. I like all of the characters, with my favorite being Titus since he has some of the most memorable and hilarious lines of the show. I quickly binge watched seasons 1 and 2 in the matter of days, but it took me a few weeks to get through season 3. I wanted to like it and I was very excited to watch it, but it was honestly a big let down compared to the previous two seasons. The jokes felt forced and I was very unhappy with some of the plot decisions. It felt like major story lines were built up only to be torn apart and it was disappointing to see that happen after spending so much time invested in them. The season 3 finale was a little better and I was relatively happy with how they set up the plot for season 4, but I'm worried they'll just repeat the same mistakes as this time around. Overall, this show is an amusing, feel good comedy and it does bring a smile to my face, I just hope that the writers will have some more focus and direction in the coming seasons."
195,Netflix,G.L.O.W.,5770786,"The 1980s wasn't just neon fabrics, side ponytails, and cream colored suits with t-shirts. It was also too much moose, too much make-up, and sock-less penny loafers. It was ugly. Brilliantly, gloriously ugly and tacky. And that's what you see in this show. Superficially speaking, this series (and its characters) looks more authentically of the era than anything else I have seen portrayed on film in the last two decades.Much of the credit goes to costume designer Beth Morgan, who sifted through photo albums to research the look of the decade, rather than fashion catalogs and television shows and seeing an obstructed, romanticized vision of the era. The characters either wear too much or not enough of everything. This was the eighties, warts and all, and just for that alone, this show is worth a look.But on top of that, you have a rich, diverse cast of characters, almost all of which are multi-dimensional and bring more to the table than just what they appear to be (while ironically trying to play up their stereotypes to promote the show they are working on). And though some characters sadly don't get the time to fully develop in just ten half-hour episodes, you have reason to believe that they will in future seasons, as the executive producers have proved before in the ongoing seasons of 'Orange is the New Black'.And then there's the men of GLOW. The women are getting plenty of praise - and deservedly so - but the few male characters depicted also get a chance to shine. Chris Lowell plays the fascinating benefactor to the entire GLOW enterprise. He's the only one - initially - with the vision of what the show should be, and although he isn't introduced until episode three ('The Wrath of Kuntar'), his presence is felt as the unseen force propelling a reluctant director and inexperienced cast to pursue this venture. Bashir Salahuddin is the epitome of the phrase ""no small parts"" in this series. He exudes a warmth that instantly brings calmness and security to anyone and everyone around him. And although he is given minimal lines and - what some may argue - a generic character in the handful of appearances he makes, you genuinely feel invested and supportive of the developments he undertakes in the latter half of the season.And finally, there's Marc Maron. Whether or not you've heard about him yet, you will soon and it will be because of this role. He plays the director enlisted with putting an all-female wrestling show together. He comes from a B-list, schlock horror background and only takes the job to finance his dream project, but despite being a sleaze ball with a predilection for the vices of the time, he also genuinely cares for people. He's a guy who will step up and stick his neck out for the people he believes in, and unlike just about all the other characters written with a drug problem, Maron's character isn't dictated by societal expectations to flounder and jeopardize the other characters around him. He's an asset, and not only that, but an absolute necessity. He's also an addict, but a functioning addict, which sadly many people in the industry were back then.Maron exemplifies everything great about this show. It's not glorifying the era, it's a raw, unapologetic, and - at times - brutally honest depiction of the 1980s in southern California: Flawed, hilarious, and tacky."
196,Netflix,Bloodline,3520702,"I loved the first 2 seasons of Bloodline. Great story and acting. But WOW!!! season 3 was terrible. I assume the writers did not know what to do to conclude this show. My wife and were so eager for this release but man what a let down. This is my first time to submit a review to IMDb as I tend to just read other reviews. However, I felt compelled to express this opinion. If you have not watched Bloodline yet, my advice is to watch and enjoy seasons 1 & 2 but stay away from this 3rd season."
197,Netflix,One Day At A Time (2017),5339440,"I started watching this show because I was bored and wanted to just have something on TV while I worked and found myself overcome with emotions. This show is amazing and I can't wait until the next season debuts. It kept me laughing, thinking, and even crying. It is a great series and the only negative thing I have to say is that there weren't enough episodes. Netflix could help me out a lot by adding 26 episodes a season instead of their typical 13. I watched the entire serious in a few short hours and now want to make sure that this show continues. In all honesty this show was more intriguing to me than many other Netflix sitcoms as well as some other shows like George Lopez.Keep up the great work Netflix!!!"
198,Netflix,Master of None,4635276,"Usually I would never go out and actually make the bold move of writing my opinion, let alone writing a review, but for this one I had to seeing how so many people are shrugging the show off for being ""bland comedy"". Frankly the show is much more than just a comedy, its more of an emotional roller-coaster. It takes different real life situation and problems and introduces them to the viewers in the a more comical way. That is what good comedians do, they are able to integrate real life with a comical twist and Aziz Ansari has not failed to do so. There are a few down points here and there, like the seemingly half hearted acting of his parents, but give them credit since they are his ACTUAL parents with no acting background. Long Story Short, This isn't a sit com, this isn't a Modern Family like unreal comedy, its real life situations and stories told through a comedians prospective."
199,Netflix,Happy Valley,3428912,"I've been thoroughly enjoying this dark gritty drama. All the leads are excellent, but Sarah Lancashire as the main police officer with a tragic family history, is outstanding. It started well then just got better and better with each episode and twist of the plot (and screw) having me on the edge of my seat. I've just watched what must be the penultimate episode and it has left me physically shaking - it was that convincing and shocking. It's hard to credit the complaint of mumbling by one reviewer. I can't recall even one line of script I didn't follow and it's usually something that bugs me. I'm so glad I've watched this series, it's got to be one of (if not the) best TV dramas of 2014."
200,Netflix,3%,4922804,"You don't review a show based on one episode. Most first episodes (of any series) are the pilot, and they don't tell much about the history, plot, acting quality. I'm not trying to defend it because I'm Brazilian, I just don't think some people are fair on their judgement (one user in particular even said he only watched the first episode, and gave it ONE star). Please guys, don't do that, reviews like that are not useful at all. I can't remember me watching a first episode of any show and thinking ""wow, the best show ever"".To be honest, I didn't like the two first episodes, but I gave the show a chance and it proved me wrong. It really gets entertaining as you watch. The actors and plot are great and the history is quite original (besides some elements from other shows). I watched the full season in 3 days or less.Just give it a shot, but please watch more than one episode."
201,Netflix,Hemlock Grove,2309295,"** May contain mild spoilers **'Hemlock Grove' is a rare and strange beast among the many current fantasy/horror shows on TV. This new series is refreshingly original; although vampirism and werewolves haven't exactly been underrepresented in movies and TV-shows over the last couple of years, 'Hemlock Grove' manages to find a very interesting new approach and uses old European myths and legends - and even a bit of Sci-Fi - to inject some fresh blood into a genre that started to feel a bit stale. The mix is strangely compelling – and highly addictive.The cast is very strong, especially the two leads Bill Skarsgård and Landon Liboiron – and of course, the always great Famke Janssen. The production values are also worth mentioning: the music, the cinematography and the set-designs in this show are absolutely beautiful, the gory make-up effects look realistic and CGI is thankfully kept to a minimum. I'm a bit surprised this show hasn't found a bigger audience yet, given how well it is produced (and this wasn't exactly a cheap affair either: season 2 had a budget of 52 million dollars for 10 episodes), but maybe it's just a bit too original for that. As far as I'm concerned, 'Hemlock Grove' certainly deserves to be seen; offering unique 'Horror' with a fantastic, slightly surreal atmosphere and amazing images, this highly original series is a prime candidate for binge-watching. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
202,Netflix,Marco Polo,2189461,"I am appalled at the ignorance of some of the things posted in the boards of this show. I think it's pretty outstanding! The casting is excellent, the attention to history in detail of costumes and culture is awesome and I rather like the fact that Marco Polo himself is more of an observer than a main character...the Mongols, especially Kublai Khan, stealing every single scene! People have bemoaned the ""stiffness"" of the actors; I can only chalk that up to very little exposure to Asian culture, film or acting! Watch some classic Asian made films and you'll see the acting in this offering is very true to form. As for casting of Chinese as Mongols when they are two very distinctly different ethnic groups,the make-up did a very credible job transforming them into believable Mongols...who are much darker in skin than Chinese, have higher cheekbones, broader faces and a more pronounced slant to the eyes than Chinese as well. The choice to have each group speak in English was a wise business decision. The biggest audience for this is Americans who don't exactly have much patience with subtitles. There was a nice combination of native languages spoken either in the background or as asides that gave one a good flavor of the languages. The attention to detail in costuming was really, really good. And for those worried about historical accuracy...there are almost 150 different editions or versions of The Travels of Marco Polo which is the travelogue ""written"" (actually spoken to a scribe) by Polo himself. They all have great flights of fantasy and magic and extremely improbable events in them so much so that some scholars have wondered if Polo had ever really been to all the places he claimed to visit, so a few inaccuracies ( like everyone speaking in English) is actually right in line with Polo's original work and actually might have been something the author himself might have appreciated. In short, stop looking for production and script flaws, stop displaying such ignorance about Asian cultures and just sit back and enjoy a darn good-adventure film!"
203,Netflix,F Is for Family,4326894,"Just finished binge watching the whole first season of this show. It is fantastic. The animation is cool, the voice acting is great and most of all the writing is superb. Maybe its because I had a similar home dynamic, but never in my life have I seen such an honest portrayal of family life and all the anger and frustration that come along with it. The voice acting is also outstanding from Bill Burr. Most people that play an angry character can make it come off quite cartoonish, yet somehow Bill Burr manages to make a cartoon come off very human by letting the anger build throughout a scene or an entire episode. I highly recommend this show."
204,Netflix,Friends From College,5565334,"I struggle to understand why critics don't enjoy this comedy as much as I do. One criticism I've heard is that none of the characters are nice people and are therefore unlikable. I disagree, there isn't a character in it I don't like, yes most of them do questionable things, make bad decisions or act inappropriately, but it makes the great television. If they were all nice people we'd end up with something annoyingly sickly sweet like This Is Us.
The comedy is dry/dark but I love this programme and I really hope the more people watch it and it gets a third series"
205,Netflix,Flaked,4973548,"I've been a fan of Will Arnett for years. But this is the first time we're seeing the true range of his acting. Chip is dark and complex in a way that is not appealing except for the fact that Will Arnett somehow manages to make a very unlikable person desirable. There are moments when watching Will Arnett as Chip that makes you completely forget that you're looking at what is usually a very funny man.Given that this was a first time writing an entire show from start to finish for Arnett, I went in with lowered expectations. While the show struggles with knowing what it wants to be in spots, the characters are deep, the inter-relationships toxic and intriguing to watch. While the plot sometimes got lost in character in fighting, I'm interested to see what will happen with a second season. This wasn't a perfect attempt but there's a great deal of heart here and that's worth it. I want more."
206,Netflix,Haters Back Off,5467814,"Meant to wait longer before writing this review but I just had to do it right now instead. I had planned to watch the entire first season (I hear there will be a second and I can't can't can't can't can't believe it) first, but I couldn't possibly sit through one more single minute of this show.I don't love or hate the YouTube videos but the idea of taking those short clips of a really annoying character and stretching it out to a half hour series is just brain numbingly awful. Who had that bright idea?The sister is a decent actor and the uncle causes a couple laughs as does Angela from The Office fame (who is Miranda's mom). The writing is painfully awful to sit through with the jokes incredibly unfunny and predictable. Anyone who does not see these jokes coming from a mile away must be blind and never experienced a single sitcom before. Boring, boring, boring.The worst part of the show though is the lead character of Miranda. The people around her are all unbelievable (except the sister) and stupid but she is the worst one of all. The whiny voice and complete lack of singing talent are of course planned but just because you write something to be intentionally bad does not somehow make it good... it's still awful to sit through!This is so bad I can't even tell for sure if this is supposed to be a comedy or a drama or a statement about modern YouTube ""stars""... it is very sad that this person is making a lot of money by being a terrible actress who pretends to sing badly, standing out as the worst person in a cast of unlikable, uninteresting characters.Netflix doesn't make too many bad mistakes but this is one of them. No season two please. Make something else instead."
207,Netflix,Degrassi: Next Class,5320160,"For over a decade I have watched Degrassi: Next Gen. and it's movies. I have a fond memories of growing up as a preteen and teenage girl waiting for each episode to come out screaming, laughing and crying online with my friends with what each character said or did. So In 2015 when I heard that the Degrassi series was going to be canceled on Teennick I was devastated; I had not watched the series in years, but it forever made a mark on me growing up. It was a guide of what to do and not to do while in JHS and/or HS. Later on it was said online what the new series of Degrassi( Next Class) was soon to be on Netflix and Canadian Television. Excited I patiently waited the day of which I was able to watch it. I called some old friends over and we binged the whole season. And... It was horrible.The first thing I noticed was the horrible opening song, with some weird remixing(?) type of new intro with pseudo snap chat and Instagram pictures and videos. And we dove right into the content, while I had to say I hated most of the characters because they were not developed correctly, whatever problems these characters went through we all laughed because we didn't care or feel for any for them. And then we have the classic: Gay guy, confused guy/girl, emo chick that's hiding a secret, on-off couple, unstable characters etc.But what bothered me and really ticked me off was there portrayals of ""social issues."" In the first and second season; they used buzz words, talked about issues that HSers do not even talk about. Seriously when you were in HS did anyone really join ""feminist club"" and tried to screw over everything you liked for no reason? I am not one to have issues when talking about racism,racial equality, sexism , LGBT rights and etc. And I even try speak about women's rights in the west and east, but they were ridiculous. When you try to do these things: DO IT RIGHT!Let me give you a few examples: -Maya calls out a heckler at a bar and he called her a B, but that's what hecklers do they heckle and if you're a performer you have to learn to deal with that. But she calls him a sexist pig as she breaks his phone.The feminist rally to get the EQUAL bathrooms of 6 for boys and girl in 7 for girls and 5 for boys. They complain that the girls bathrooms are always crowded. I agreed with this until my friend said, ""of course they are; girls usually fix their makeup in there, bring friends that don't need to go, have periods and do more things in there than boys do."" What BS, they end up rallying and shame all the guys that want to keep the bathrooms equal-They shame a white girl who is on the volley ball team who accidentally drew a black member of a rival team as a monkey and that girl who did acted like it was nothing. They then say she did it because she has white privilege and doesn't know anything about racism and she is a racist.*HOWEVER, the writers of this stupid show could have used that episode to show that the girl was privileged not because she was white but because her parents and rich and have influence. But, no you're white and you did that it doesn't matter if it was an accident, you're still a racist.They have a protest for a black kid who was wrongfully suspended( which was right, he was some guy body slammed him and he defended himself) But they focus that said volleyball player got no time for being racism of which they didn't tell anyone! NO ONE WENT TO THE PRINCIPLE OR TEACHER OR TELL THEIR PARENTS?!-The characters get super easily offended, a police officer says that they should muzzle their friend, she is Hispanic in return that doesn't mean he's saying for them to shut-up, but he is calling her a dog. (Yes words don't mean words) A teacher says man power and a student says he was sexist. Misunderstandings are racist,sexist and homophobic. And even if you get everything right about a culture down to the T if you wear tradition clothing of speak the language you're so insensitive and horrible.Just watch the 2 seasons, I got so mad half way the 2nd I stopped watching. This isn't HS, at most they are trying to act like this is college with the things these kids do.Overall a someone who has watched since the first season of next gen, this is disappointing. The writers of this show are following some radical SJW book and acting as if this is what you should be doing in HS, no it isn't. These shallow characters always go on another person for doing something they like. Every episode someone is offended and cries that no one with listen and blah blah blah.Utterly disappointing, I guess this is what you do when you've washed up 2-3 decades of this type of show... I wish I could give it a 0/10."
208,Netflix,Dope,7782022,"Great show, very interesting take on the modern view of the war on drugs from both sides of the law!"
209,Netflix,Marseille,4003966,"Though I'm not french I've been living in France for almost 10 years and I speak french. I think I can understand why french people is hating this series. I presume they're looking into details that non- french speakers won't take notice: accents, way of acting, rhythm, dialogues, etc. The french viewers and filmmakers are used to other kind of stories and language (in addition, french people love to take down their own work! You won't never hear them saying ""this is good"", they will say ""it's not bad/c'est pas mal"")The series is worth the watch. There's an evolution in the characters that might have been done better, but acting and script it's not as bad as critics have said. Not the best series I'll see this year, but I've loved it as it radically changed from most of the other options you have on Netflix: American or British productions.I hope there'll be a 2nd season."
210,Netflix,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp,4341500,"Crazy? Check.Stupid? Check.Nonsensical? Check.Hilarious? Check.But did you expect anything less from a Wet Hot American Summer prequel?Fans of David Wain's 2001 cult comedy Wet Hot American Summer will be jumping for joy at this show. The humour is much the same yet somehow manages to become even more random with some of the craziest subplots I think I may have ever seen, however it is all consistently funny and had me laughing non- stop. But above all the show is incredibly meta, a tough job done well!Seeing the cast of the original return for this was a real joy to behold. The likes of Elizabeth Banks, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper and Amy Poehler effortlessly slip back into their roles and seem to pick up right where they left off in 2001, seeing how these actors have hit the big time with their careers only heightens the hilarity of seeing them return to their roles 15 years on, the meta aspect of this being a prequel series with the older actors only adds in to make the mere concept of the show even funnier. However seeing the likes of Janeane Garofalo, Michael Showalter, Zak Orth, Michael Ian Black and Christopher Meloni reprising their roles is also a real joy to behold, especially given that they may not have had careers that reached the same heights as Rudd and Cooper. And you can tell that they are all having a blast!The rest of the cast is simply hilarious with a whole host of big, new names joining the show furthering the meta aspect of the show. New additions include Randall Park, Jason Schwartzman, Michael Cera, John Hamm, Lake Bell, Kirsten Wiig, Weird Al and Chris Pine among others.But in the midst of all this hilarity, just when you think that it can't get any funnier, something dawns on you...All these events are happening over the course of one day.One day.The only downside to this show is that there are only 8 episodes, we need more!!!For fans of the original, this will not disappoint. For new Wet Hot American Summer viewers, welcome to the chaotic comedy that is Wet Hot American Summer."
211,Netflix,Club de Cuervos,4680240,"Most European based males, like myself, tend to have a (misplaced) arrogance when it comes to knowledge surrounding the continents most played sport: Football/Soccer. With in mind that Club de Cuervos/Club of Crows (2015) is a Netflix-production from Mexico, I didn't know what to expect when getting this series recommended to me.Club de Cuervos (CDC) revolves around two siblings who inherit a Mexican First-division Soccer club based in the small town of Nuevo Toledo when their father and nationwide-loved owner of the team dies. Siblings being Siblings, from day one the co-ownership turns into a power struggle between the two protagonists who couldn't be more different from one another even if they tried. Younger brother Chava Iglesias is a brass, party-loving socialite without a sense of responsibility while his sister Isabel Iglesias-Reina is more mature and focused despite having the tendency of being a bit naive.The contradiction between them makes this a little gem from the get go. The ongoing power struggle makes for great enjoyment and instant comedic situations. The on-screen chemistry between Chava (Luiz Gerardo Mendez) and Isabel (Mariana Trevino) is spot on and close to subliminal.Although most of the show is centered around Chava and Isabel there are some notable characters who make up for interesting side-stories. ""Best of the rest"" is without doubt Chava's asistent Hugo Sanchez (Jesus Zavala), every time this character graces the screen I'll immediately get a grin on my face at worst, at best he makes sure I'll end up on the floor laughing. The stunning Mary Luz (Stephanie Cayo) will keep all male (and probably a decent amount of females) eyes glued to the screen, her role as femme fatale and antagonist to Isabel gets bigger in season two but is pivotal to the first installment.We also get to know some of the actual Soccer playing squad members, their roles not to in-depth. Still the likes of Potro (Joaquin Fereira) and Tony (Juan Pablo de Santiago) are portrayed in a way resembling a big percentage of modern day soccer athletes (not to bright, vain and egocentric).With decent enough plot-twists, moments of full-out laughter and a stable and definitely very able cast you would be forgiven for binging the 3 season show in a weekend. Yes, sometimes CDC comes across as a ""Telenovela"" but it definitely will keep you entertainedIf you are a diehard soccer fan and have reasonable knowledge of the sport then some of the inaccuracies may put you off. But then again this just isn't a show centered around the actual sport itself but much more then that.Writing credits go to Alesia Constantini (Scrubs) and Jay Dyer (Californication) who do an excellent job as this is their first time doing a non American gig.Enjoyment: 8/10 Entertaining, comedic, plot-twists.Writing: 8/10 American based writers but very little gets lost in translation.Cast: 9/10 Main characters are superbly cast. Recurring characters can be a bit flat, whe never really get to know their background.Total 8/10I'm out, enjoy, peace!"
